pilot: Amsterdam hello K L M two five bravo passing two thousand
atc: hello K L M two five bravo climb flight level niner zero
pilot: flight level niner zero K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo call one two four eight eight zero
pilot: standby K L M two five bravo we might have to take care of a problem
atc: okay maintain flight level one three zero you can stay on this frequency
pilot: maintain one three zero copied K L M two five bravo
atc: amsterdam K L M two five bravo
atc: go ahead
pilot: we would like to return to schihol we need about ten minutes to complete procedures inform passengers and probably lose some weight
atc: okay two five bravo turn left heading three five zero
pilot: left turn heading three five zero K L M two five bravo
atc: are you okay with vectors
pilot:yes but we need about ten more minutes related to weight and we can land but we have to brief the cabin and get set up
atc: but if i call you is that ok
pilot: no that is not a problem we do not have any failure or anything now it is just a vibration when on full power for now only at full power but from company they would like us to return
atc: expect three six right for landing
pilot: three six right copy that K L M two five bravo
pilot: departure K L M three niner yankee
atc: hello K L M three niner yankee climb flight level one three zero radar contact
pilot: climb flight level one three zero K L M three niner yankee
atc: K L M two five bravo descend flight level one one zero and contact one two six decimal six eight zero discrete frequency
pilot: descend flight level one one zero and one two six six eight zero K L M two five bravo
pilot: amsterdam hello K L M two five bravo descending flight level one one zero
atc: K L M two five bravo this is discrete frequency at the moment so you can take all your time expect a left turn here in a few miles to keep you near the field
pilot: roger and we are ready for the approach K L M two five bravo
atc: sorry you said you are ready for the approach
pilot: affirm
atc: K L M two five bravo turn left heading one niner zero
pilot: left heading one niner zero K L M two five bravo
atc:K L M two five bravo just to be sure no assistance needed upon landing 
pilot: negative for the moment not K L M two five bravo
atc: okay that is copied and i am gonna sort things about the runways wind is right in between the three six right and the runway two seven
pilot: crosswind limit is three one so not a problem K L M two five bravo
atc: that is copied at the moment two seven gives you three one zero two niner gusting forty and i see crosswind of two niner for that
pilot: we can accept two seven if that is more convenient two five bravo
atc: yea i am going to coordinate with the tower
pilot: in the meantime request further descent K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo heading one eight zero descend flight level niner zero
pilot: one eight zero descend flight level niner zero K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo it will be runway two seven descend now to flight level five zero
pilot: two seven and descend flight level five zero K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo turn left heading one six zero i will give you some extra track miles
pilot: left one six zero K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo you will cross the localizer for the altitude so no rush for that it will be a right turn after corossing the localizer
pilot: that is copied roger K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo turn right heading two four zero 
pilot: right turn two four zero K L M two five bravo
pilot: K L M two five bravo any windshear report last half an hour
atc: two five bravo descend now to negative maintain flight level five zero for the time
pilot: maintain five zero K L M two five zero
atc: K L M two five bravo no windshear reported on runway two seven for the last half hour and for your information it is going to be a slight delay vectors to vector you behind traffic landing on the three six right for now turn right heading three six zero
pilot: right turn three six zero K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo descend to two thousand feet Q N H one zero one zero
pilot: two thousand one zero one zero K L M two five bravo
atc: etihad four eight sierra approach
pilot:  etihad four eight sierra
atc: etihad four eight sierra the latest wind for the runway three six right is three two zero degrees with two two gusting four five is this still outside of your limits
pilot: still outside our limits we will hold around ten minutes or so and then we will make a decision
atc: roger keep me updated
pilot: thank you
atc: K L M five two golf reduce speed to two hundred knots 
pilot: speed two hundred K L M five two golf
atc: ryanair three one yankee zulu speed two twenty descend flight level four zero correction descend flight level four five
pilot: descending flight level four five ryanair three one yankee zulu
atc: K L M one zero seven four turn right heading one four zero
pilot: right heading one four zero K L M one zero seven four
atc: easy one seven november romeo number one call tower one one niner decimal two three zero
pilot: departure hello alpine niner three charlie bravo passing flight level three zero climbing flight level six zero volla three victor
atc: alpine niner three charlie bravo climb flight level three zero
pilot: climb flight level one three zero alpine niner three charlie bravo
atc: K L M five two golf descend flight level four five
pilot: flight level four five K L M five two golf
atc: etihad four eight sierra let me know what your limits are please for runway three six right
pilot: standby eithad four eight sierra
atc: K L M two five bravo the heading three zero zero cleared I L S approach runway two seven
pilot: heading three hundred cleared I L S two seven K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo at the moment crosswind is showing two niner the wind is three one zero three three gusting four two even going down to two eight
pilot: roger K L M two five bravo
atc: are you fully established
pilot: affirm K L M two five bravo
atc: K L M two five bravo contact the tower one one niner decimal two three zero
pilot: one one niner two three thank you K L M two five bravo
atc: you are welcome
pilot: tower hello K L M two five bravo established I L S two seven
atc: K L M two five bravo runway two seven the wind is about stand by here shortly for that wind over there is three one zero three four maximum is forty two
pilot: roger K L M two five bravo
atc: you are number one
atc: K L M two five bravo runway two seven three one zero two niner gust four two clear to land
pilot: two seven cleared to land K L M two five bravo
pilot: tower hello K L M five two golf three six right
atc: hello K L M five two golf three six right three two zero two five gust four two cleared to land
pilot: ok cleared to land three six right in case of missed approach we would like to climb two thousand feet
atc: K L M five two golf approved
