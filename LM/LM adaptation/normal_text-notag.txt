hey hi i'm justine and i'm majoring in english literature
er yes it was
yeah it was
er because i really like literature and there's not much else i'm very good at so
yes i did all the way yah
i think it was compulsory in secondary school then after that er it was interesting ah it was more interesting than any other subject so yah
i guess so
er year four
er yes in my first and second year i joined the school muay thai and brazilian jiu jitsu club
then uh in my second year also i joined er acapella group
yah and currently i'm only still in that acapella group
it's actually those unproper c c as they're interest groups ah but er we meet once or twice a week and then we
uh and like s for those interested in fighting but
muay thai is a lot of er
kicking and punching whereas b j j is a lot of floor work so you're hugging a lot of people on the ground rolling around yah
no not good but because the guy i liked was there so i went there
oh erm oh they have this thing called er i think the correct term is midies yah where they separate the different parts remember i was talking about the soprano alto all that yah so they er have er
like a i won't say video audio recording of each individual but which you can listen to
yah
yah and i'm more of a audio learner than a visual in this case cause i can't read notes so yah that helps a lot
correct yah
oh definitely
er i have to combine with the other people and sing together but i think singing together also is very important yah so
practice is very important yes both with yourself and with the entire group yes yah
yes that's right
personally for me er
uh i think it's
well i mean for one thing it's finding the right people to sing with people you want to sing with but after that also i think it's translating er your normal singing into performance singing
yah because uh singing to each other is very different from performing to a crowd of people yah
and that can goes back to that thing i was saying about stepping out of my comfort zone because
quite hard unless somebody uh like
like for example when i perform i like to look at the floor i dont like to look at people
cause it's easier to concentrate on my note when i'm looking at the floor but yah so you've like maintaining eye contact making sure you look like you're enjoying yourself or appropriate to whatever the mood of the song is and if choreo is necessary remembering your choreo but still singing properly
so yah the the
entire performance aspect of acapella is something that is
difficult for me yah but
yah er
it's not really self defence but it's a good form of exercise
but i mean that's the whole point right to get better so hopefully yah especially the dancing part
thank you
er yah currently i'm the welfare officer for the club yes
er supposely lah yes yes yes i try i try i try yes as a as the
its very hard to
uh individually help everybody because er of the way the club is and i think it would be difficult or for them to want to approach me specifically as well because i'm sure they have their own problems but er as much as i can like for example we ce help celebrate their birthdays we organize bonding events for them and uh
but maybe cause i suck at it if you're good at it maybe you can use it in real life yah
yah but currently due to a lack of a concrete
er of permanent club room i think like a lot of er what i could do it
er cannot be done
yah because we move eh we have a room in the hive but uh i mean it's a common classroom so we can't leave any of our stuff there
you're welcome
no i would run
if i can help can help orh but if not i would it will make more sense to leave and get help from elsewhere yes
yes i stayed during my first year
er as in the hall life wasn't for me
uh it was very tiring and everybody wanted was always doing something you had to be doing something or like in a lot of committees in order to ensure hall stay for the following year
and it just felt like a lot of effort for me and i couldn't have time to study or have time to myself yah
yah it was
yah correct
so like they have a lot of sub committees and committees uh for different events so uh i had to join
a b hall block commitee the sub comm and then i had to join like their newspaper slash magazine sub comm also and a whole bunch of different sports slash er what they call them games there's what i think there was er
what do you call that thing there were darts there was scrabble there was boggle
got there was netball there was volleyball
it's a lot and correct and yah i didn't have time at all to do my own work yah so it was very tiring
yah it was at night
oh my god yah every night
every night i'll be awake until maybe two or three easily
yah
i still sleep at two or three sometimes but er at least i have more time to myself and more time to do the things that i really want to do not just things i'm forced to do yah
like er acapella singing
okay so er the acapella group is called harmonics er it's very new it's about one or two years old uh
er what what about it would you like to know about
i mean we sing ah er we we have different we have like sub groups each group has about maybe six to eight people then er we have our own repertoire each group and then we go out and do gigs
yah
normal singing
er over one thing acapella means er without i believe it means without instrument or purely vocals so yah that's one thing then another thing is uh because i was from choir in secondary school and j c is er and that has safety in numbers whereas acapella is one person per part
so that er
really causes you to have to believe in yourself and in your teammates yah
its a bit different
to be honest i really hate performing i'm very shy
uh up to now i still don't really like it ah but uh it's
fun and enjoyable to perform with my teammates so
that encourages me to step out of my comfort zone so every time we perform i'm stepping out of my comfort zone but yah but it's okay because i'm not alone they are there
yah
correct yah
er i was a soprano in choir then when i came to acapella i they make me alto but then now they make me sop again so
i suppose yes same part
soprano oh sopranos they have like different sections this is from highest to lowest uh soprano alto tenor bass and then in between they have like mezzo sop which is like in between soprano and alto and baritone which i believe is in between tenor and bass
yah so it's just different sections for your vocal range yes
you
play a keyboard and if you can hit the note i suppose that is your range i'm not a musical person
i think it's highly recommended that you have musical background but yah it definitely helps ah like reading notes and stuff but no i don't have musical background yes
this will take a very long time because i need think about there are a lot of performances um
um memorable
i think last year we participated in this thing called acapellia art
acapella championships it's like a
er open thing ah there're different categories but basically anybody can join yah and
er we didn't train for very long we train for like less than two months i think but there was something special about that group yah and i
it was very thrilling but also very scary because there was choreography and if there's one thing i cannot do it's dance
ah okay yes
not dancing
alright
er i like to read
yah i like to watch movies yah and
i like to spend time with my dog
yes i have a dog
okay so she's a west highland terrier which kinda looks like that er snowy from tin tin yah but she's not very white she's very brown because she likes to play in the mud
yeah so she's er seven years old this year
er dog years so she's like middle aged she's like forty nine eh seven human years so for in dog years she's forty nine i think
yah
yes
er i like yoga i suppose cause like i have anemia so that means if i do anything too quickly or too strenuously then i get dizzy
so i can't do much
but i do like to exercise i really enjoyed muay thai and b j j yah but just that the company in harmonics er is a lot more enjoyable so i picked
acapella singing over the other sports clubs in school yah
er yah also because er i think practices fall on the same day that's one thing
and another thing is er
yah i re needed to juggle school work as well so to choose two out of three
is er grades er that's not something yah
oh my god er
yah no actually no
it's probably sleep too much and then the other two suffer as a result
i know but what time do i wake up
yah
er any time between seven to twelve eh er seven a m to twelve p m depending on whether i have class or not but yes
on weekends ah er oh cause uh actually i currently only have two days of school so i give tuition to this boy five times every other day that i don't have class so i on saturday and sunday at about eight a m i have tuition ah so i have to wake up early on weekends
yah correct
er english
er primary two
yah
so like he's from his family is from mainland china they moved here a couple of years ago so er
my job is to inculcate the interest in reading in him ah yah so uh i won't say it's it okay it's not easy but he's er it's really up to the students' like
attitude towards er receiving the learning and he's not bad like he's quite receptive and he's quite smart
but he's very lazy so
pros and cons yah
for example he will complain like every time i ask him to do something he will complain but er
i guess it's
a mixture of like letting him complain a bit because i mean you've been there before you understand how you don't want to do something but er also encouraging him
like especially when he gets something right like he respond very well to positive feedback yah so that's been helping
yes i am stereotypical literature student er
job but yes yah
er as in
i i didn't want to teach literature so it would be j c but there's no demand for that currently so i suppose primary school because i like working with kids
yah
wow personal question er
ideally i would think two
kids yeah one boy one girl ideally but you cannot control this kind of thing so
yah
no i have a younger sister yeah that's right
fantastic
yah
i didn't mean that sarcastically er in the past when we were growing up i think we fought a lot but after a certain point i think after we she entered junior college then we just became very close
yah so we share everything and we talk about everything ah yah i mean we still fight that's normal but yah
er she's actually in n t u as well she is er wee kim wee major
er does she sing no but she dances really well so the the one thing i cannot do she can do very well
i think i think so so actually is not fair she can do both probably but i can only do one
it it's been twenty four years and nothing has happened for me ah but i guess yah we shall see
oh my god okay yes me too
yes that's right
er yes i am this year actually but with a different group of people yah
as in you want me to compare last year's group with this year's group or in general oh okay
for one thing i mean personality to begin with is very important ah if you all don't click on a certain level then it's very hard to firstly find songs that you all wanna do together
uh because people have very different tastes and another thing is perhaps your working style is very different maybe some people are more systematic some people a little bit more unorthodox then if cannot work together then there are a lot of problems
okay so
er when you learn scores or we learn when we learn songs you can choose to learn er via a score
and all the parts are nicely er written out for you or you could erm make your own arrangement which er requires er doing everything from scratch
or it could be taking a score and tweaking the score also so yah
uh that's one part when i mean unorthodox i mean it's not following a certain set of instructions and another thing is uh how people learn
yah so some people
er sit down and then they go through everything step by step but other people maybe er not consistent yah only
ah my brain hurts like
it's as and when basically
people work differently so i'm by unorthodox yah if you're not the usual kind of learner yah correct
to be honest
i wanna say i am orthodox but i can't really read scores very well so i still need help from my teammates
but luckily they're all very talented so
ah thanks
thanks
uh i'm having a class erm right before this um session
so i was at the
er south spine
having um i accounting lesson
erm i in accountancy
er year two sem two
uh yes it is my first choice because erm
when i was in poly i was doing business admin so it's quite a general erm course
so from there i start to realize like what i actually like
because i tend to get to try different areas of business so after trying i realised that eh financial accounting is something i like because it is very erm
clear like
once you get it you get it not unlike the rest of the module like erm
a bit fluff i feel so i was like esh is this correct or is this wrong very subjective so i thought that ah accounting is what i want so when i was here in uni year one i realize that er it's a bit
different from what i expected
so yah
uh how is it different
what i learnt is way too in depth already
what we do in poly also but not that difficult but yah we also did like a lot of practice like you know all the things
so yah
i prefer working just that that experience is like
yah totally different
but the thing about that i prefer i decide what makes me erm decide to
erm go on to financing er to accounting now it's also because i feel that after that three years in poly i didn't really learn much is
too much calculation and yah that's all that
the uh that time i remember a year three
uh before we like erm decided where we want to go like either work or continue applying for uni erm
uni so we were sitting down in a group then we're like er okay
so what we actually learn from this whole
whole erm poly education then we were like don't know eh i think do nice presentation so we don't have like really a very
confident answer like oh
our steps is okay we learn statistic so okay we can use that our excel is very good you know
like skills part a bit we have no idea what to put there also
so this is what makes me like think that i need to go on to something that erm is more specialised so that i know that after i graduate okay this is
yah
that time i was like sixteen seventeen so i know i want to do into this industry like
the general <unk> more general costs
you don't have to make decision on like
where to go or what you want to do so we can get to try different style
uh yah i didn't want to make a choice then
if now i were to go back to that time or advise another person at my age i think is good to
think through it
because at the end
you unless you really know that oh you like marketing like all these to learn all these skills then you feel that it's very er subjective ah some people feel it's good because it force you to`
even though i have a lot lots of complain about this but i still love it lah like i can see myself doing it erm after i graduate
be more
er there's a lot of presentation for my course so we tend to work with different groups so we are very used to like working with different people er for every sem and every mod we work with different people so
even if changing environment or what it doesn't really affect us we can like adapt easily so i think this is one of the take away from my
course other than that i think
yes yes
because uh after i graduate i tend i plan to continue in this industry and also continue to see how i can improve myself in that area like see what i'm lacking in like the skills or what l'm lacking so i can continue to upgrade myself even after i graduate from
erm i don't really have a club that i joined but er i tend to take up like classes outside like previously during erm
my summer break
before that uh before this sem i was actually doing my erm internship i took an l o a so
while i was working erm from nine to six like during the weekend and after work i tend to have a lot extra time because unlike school we don't have to like erm bring work back home to do or what so i have more times
that's the time where i start to like erm learn more about other things like
insurance
i go for classes like to see like how come there's so many people so interested in this industry so i go for their classes which is like erm you don't have to pay up for anything but you just go for the lesson to have a feel to understand more about what people are actually talking about so that's what i tend to spend during my leisure time
at the start because it is six month erm internship it is my first time working for so long so at the start i still very feel very you know i enjoy and like you know erm
because t g i f is really t g i f
ya damn weekend you really like rest
erm starting really after three months right you start to feel a bit nine to six is like too long already even if you got nothing because erm
uh during working hours right you tend to have like sometime it's off peak hour so you have like erm more time for yourself but you still have to stuck in that office you know you have non like you cannot go anywhere you cannot keep visiting the pantry or the toilet so you <unk> just have to sit there then you realize that
when you knock of that time is already like
uh the sun already set
so you like you miss you really miss the sun you know like because in the morning like eight plus i will reach office then i think i will go out around twelve plus so that's the only time you get to feel the sun
yes yes otherwise you are like trap in that office like
yes yes yes
so right now is like even though you have lots of time like because i arranged my time table in the way that i only attend class in the morning i prefer morning class so after twelve plus i have my time like on time but you have to allocate time to your revision and all those catching up with the assignment all those
okay like for the class because erm like for one module i'll only attend like they make it in a way like we only attend class for three hours in a week yah so lesser time lesser class er seminar but more readings ah yes more time yah
to do reading yes own own revision
no i take like forensic science
interesting i don't think
it is interesting because you tend to learn way more than what you can absorb so at the end of the class you feel that oh you are overwhelmed by all the information
what i find it interesting after finals then yah you start to recall back what you learn then okay ah still quite fun like
but during that erm
semester itself you have lots of things to cope so you don't really feel like
ya ya
volunteered stuff i volunteered in c d a c
er some um c d a this uh
place where we tend to help like uh teaching the primary school the um less fortunate primary school student like in tutoring them in their work or what so there is once
er we actually have this you know every year we have these erm at the start of the year we have these erm seminar
prepared for secondary uh poly student darren and and themselves uh the student themselves so what this seminar is about is that to prepare them on what poly life is about because on from secondary school to poly a bit different
so we tend to like share with them what er they weren't ex expect from this uh education
and no erm
yah to prepare themselves ah so i get the opportunity to erm be the emcee for that seminar yah so i think that is the a very
memorable experience for me
too um
on and off on and off yah
travelled anywhere i like thailand
yah is
um within my budget
but at the same time it still can you know travel out of singapore
yes yes yes yes
i think is the people
um like
you can feel like
when you are shopping the shopping is not the main thing is that how you interact with the seller
like they are always so
excited about something i don't know like you can feel that their
the level of energy they have is like
very high then i'm like are they always like that because in singapore you tend to see that people are more focusing on their cellphone or they just follow you around but you they are a bit
they don't look that
excited or passion about your arrival or anything they just oh you are here okay then er anything but
in thailand they will tend to i think it's the way they speak or what their tone is very high so you feel that uh their energy level is so high then you feel you can feel their
what are their excitement also
ah yes
that's what i'm thinking like er in year three i need to clear like erm two more u e so i'm thinking of either thai or korea korean language this two
wah so you clear what the level one level one for both which one you think it's manageable like
the wording right
um how you learn like you memorize or you just
oh like all the words just keep throwing at you er i see
okay
so you think after level one of two both the language korean and thai right
can you like apply it in like
in real life like you can you speak like proper like okay bit and pieces here and there like when people speak to you can you like understand a bit
so you plan to continue which one like you prefer which one like if you were to take a level two
kor korea wow
easier to re
i see
uh so from what you explain right i look forward to that plus already like next time i'm taking them
yes
places i want to work
not much on that but places i want to visit any place like
beside the city area i'm more towards like sightseeing i prefer sightseeing and those rural area
away from city hm
either korea japan or taiwan these three
yes yes
i feel i not sure i think
er because
europe all these places like
a bit distant like i don't feel er
i don't feel a bit uh like
i can't relate to them i feel
yah but for asia wise i think our culture and the food we eat and all those i not sure i think i can relate better
yah
oh another thing is uh i prefer using chopstick yah i need chopstick in like you know every meal or what like even if i'm eating rice then they are like eh how come you don't want to use a fork and spoon i'm like urgh
chopsticks is good yes
yah
it depends eh like for me like
if i'm on my own i'm okay with anything
but i tend to follow the majority
ha depends on what people want to eat then i just okay i don't have a erm preference or what yah
no
poly um i think poly
for my course right it's different from i didn't know
this difference until i erm graduate from poly so this is what happened uh during poly uh for my course i'm doing business admin so we focus a lot a lot on like those marketing soft skills representation uh as compared to banking finance and accounting course they are more erm
book related like <unk> ah they emphasise heavily on finals like their paper but for us it's like our a huge percentage is focused on our presentation so we our lecturer will keep telling us like no the slides must be like er a lot of animation as dramatic as possible you know our presentation is like
we need to perform in class one to entertain like there's entertainment erm
marks yah component in that presentation so
i thought that you know i at school is poly is like that
yah so that's why that's why i was i keep saying like when
i entered uni the difference it's like wah
so different until i spoke to like erm my er accounting and banking finance erm peers then they are like er actually this is something
is it are you asking right now
to get from north spine to hive
kay right now we're at b4 of computer science block so what you can do is that you just take a lift
up to the first floor
then um
walk out of this block itself then when you walk out of this block you turn left and walk straight all the way
you will soon see a nanyang auditorium or
a coffee bean i think at that point of time it's very easy for you to ask someone that was there
then um
to get to the hive erm
you can just pass by the starbucks
and walk down the st f er a long flight of stairs
then uh walk straight you were eventually seeing a lecture hall
i think it's a me what i can't remember the name
but that lecture area is very iconic like it has big panels of glass
kay so that that is very iconic so uh so when you see the
um lecture right
you just turn right you will see a staircase that leads down so you just go down the staircase
oh my god
um what singaporeans do ah
oh singaporeans like that always like to do this one thing
the first thing they see a queue they will queue
they won't ask sir what are you queuing for they won't ask they see a queue
then afterwards you go around the staircase
the first thing that comes to my mind is not to ask is that um there must be g free and good stuff
cause that's all singaporeans are all about free
okay so it's like they will just queue queue queue then at the end of when they reach the start of the queue ah they'll be like
er sorry ah what what are we queuing for ah
then they'll get what they want
hm then they will leave satisfied but sometimes they they'll be a bit angry ah because they queue for nothing but they deserve it
so um they also like to some some weird behavior that singaporeans do is that they also like to use um their own singlish
so um
as you grow up
make a u turn
you were exposed to different type of
singlish
so let's say primary school
primary school ah what they know ah
is they will know buay tahan
they will know
come i clap for you they will say confirm plus chop
then when you level up ah so as in when you go j c or secondary school
what they like to say ah is chio bu
i don't know how to describe that but you may look around at that floor at that yah at that floor you will see koufu see koufu right walk straight walk straight down the f you will see a flight of stairs walk straight again
then they also like to say b g r
then they also like to say bojio
so all these right um just a quick explanation
bojio
is like
i didn't ask you to join me so it's like
they felt left out so that's why they say bojio they want to be invited
so for bo liao
is that nothing better to do
yah so then uh chio bu it is the hokkien way of calling someone
that is pretty but actually it's very rude
then uh come i uh what's that ah what ah come i clap for you right it's like er
being sarcastic like i don't really want to clap for you but i'm saying it so you feel entertained so and confirm plus chop is like
let's not ask what they're gonna chop but
it's just to say that i'm very sure that it is the case even if i have to bet things
that involved chopping
then uh
let's just go through this list of singlish
cause i guess singlish is a very big part of singaporeans
so um just
uh abuthen
is like
the more popular say is like you don't say so it's like it's like it's a given like you should have known it
uh eleven b is um the pass that
uh we have to ho men have to hold on during their national service for the rest of their life
and uh for the first two years they will be finding something else not the eleven b but the pink i c
that a lot of people take for granted
then afterwards um
but uh anyway and the five cs
erm doesn't concern me uh okay it <unk> not concern me uh fine but uh what is it ah condo credit card
i don't know lah but the five cs mayb do you know
i don't know also okay but anyway um ah beng ah lian right is like the equivalent of
um male gangster and female gangster
ah kua means
a bit sensitive let's not talk about it because you are conservative then uh
walking forward when by the time you reach the lower floor of koufu i think you will be able to see
an zhua right it means that what's up
in english ah
ang moh
kay lah sometimes you also don't call ang moh but ang moh refers to caucasian
itchy backside ah
it's not really doesn't mean that your backside is itchy doesn't me your buttocks is itchy it means that
you did something
that was necces not necessary and end up you have to pay the consequences
i i think
so uh g g
depends on the context they're saying g g if you say in a game it means good game
if you say to others that did something wrong
eh you g g already it means that
good game also good game but
in a way it means that
you're in deep shit
so
uh but if you say that you can also say i am g g home
it can also be interpreted i'm gonna go home
uh you know the dimsum
it depends on the context
then erm
okay then also shag
shag means tired
but it means something else on the dictionary lah
the dimsum thing right
they will use that in their complaints
wah this one damn shag
then you like add a damn so that it amplify because it's like apparently shag is not enough they must put damn shag so it's like yah so shag is like after you do something wah i feel damn shag it can be it is like i feel damn shag is like er noun
the dimsum basket
then this is
this shag me out
also can be used as a verb so
uh depends on how you want to use it ah
yah you the hive looks like that so just walk towards there
but don't take the lift
because the lift is very bad
outside of n t u
not too far
you know boon lay jurong point
uh the basement um they sell very nice they sell very nice ramen
then uh what i but i i like honestly i like the don more but a lot of my friends they like the ramen there so uh you if you want to have the both best of both worlds they have this set that gives you a mini ramen and a mini don
and a plate of gyoza
worth it should try so that that one is quite good uh and there's another fantastic place if you're going the lunch time
go to there this cafe
beside ya kun
the place
okay is it is sell lunch set lunch set uh it's from i think eleven if not wrong or one two five i not sure but i know it ends at five
so um you can just go and the food there is actually very worth it like erm
what did i order
i i <unk> like three times already so um i would say that the ingredients they use right
are very fresh
and i had their iced lemon tea
they they they give you the iced tea right is
it it tastes very different from any usual tea because it's it's kind of like expensive uh more expensive type of a tea
uh it's black tea lah then um you just add your own the the amount of sugar syrup that you want so that that is like you can customise to your same taste
uh one more dish i like from them that it's not under the lunch set is actually this uh potato fries
with truffles salted egg sauce
legit i brought to the cinema
wah so good
really you should try
yah not not not i mean it's normal lah so yah so it's really very good but the uh their the lunch sets right is very worth it and they give enough ingredients they give you plentiful and give you fresh ingredients and
yah that time what ah
i think i had some seafood one scallop
yah the sauce is wah so good i ordered the steak also the steak was a bit erm
some parts not medium rare some parts medium rare so
still quite good lah the sauce like yah but you know
but the place very organized
y i assume that you'll be going from hive
so uh opposite hive there's a there's a bus stop
um opposite in the direction of the koufo lah
so you'll see a bus stop
then uh what you can do is that you can actually take a bus one seven nine
and uh alight at the last stop because it will stop at the
boon lay bus interchange
so when you alight from the interchange you are actually at jurong point already
so just find your way uh for for the japanese food that i said just now as i said it's actually at the basement the l the bottom basement it's uh at this japanese street so you go through that street everything is japanese food
japanese food is the best so um
then for the one that i told you about that one is don't know how to describe but i would assume that that was around like the second last floor
yah it's beside ya kun
shopping ah
what do you want to shop for
hm honestly i don't recommend though uh but er i think boon lay is good enough honestly like they have quite a number of
clothes but but if you are willing to go further go to like suntec harbourfront
uh i mean vivocity lah harbourfront those are the bigger malls uh if you want a street wear go bugis street or some place you can sort or place that you can go is at the cit tanjong pagar there what is that place called ah
i can't remember what's that place city plaza is it i think city plaza but what i know is that that plaza has arnold chicken

and they sell mostly female clothes so eh i think it'll be quite suitable for you
er boon lay one er i assume you already know
so uh to get to the
bugis street is
just take uh the green line in your case from boon lay all the way to bugis
or if you want to go suntec you can also take a bus from
to suntec straight away or you can walk from there if you want ah miss it's very near then uh if you want to go harbourfront uh you probably have to
take to the buona vis buona vista and then just take the line straight down to harbourfront it's the last station
yah i think that's reasonably close lah so
tanjong pagar tanjong pagar is erm it's a little bit bef it's a few stations before
um bugis so from boon lay to tanjong pagar is nearer then going to bugis because the tanjong pagar is in between tanjong um boon lay and

okay
uh no i don't stay in hall because yah i stay quite near to n t u so
okay if you are at the s a c and you want to go to coffee bean right okay you exit er s a c and
you
just walk straight down
you will pass by a
i think the printing
some printing shop to your right and then you walk just keep walking straight down you will pass by the bus that that convenience store
keep walking straight you uh that there'll be this like open plaza thing there's a giant t v down there you can't miss it
on the left i think there's booklink and
prime supermarket i i can't remember what's on the right because yah i i know there's dunkin donuts yah there's is so you just w walk straight down then there were uh
you that you can go to the l to your left or to your right but i think to your right is better because i usually take the to the r the path to the right so you just
turn right and then you turn left again and there'll be a long long path down
yah so you just keep walking down that path and
yah yah so we are a quite materialistic society
abuden abuden is like
uh it's a local slang of like saying er you don't say you know like yah you don't say you don't say
you will
uh like
okay i i give you a hypothetical scenario so like for example you know i
i
i went to the
the toilet to take a dump yah and then and then you you came by and then you ask me eh when you take a dump do you take off for your pants so like abuden of course yah yah
yah
act blur act blur basically is er er like
it's also yah all of these are singapore slangs so act blur is like what it literally means acting blur so
uh usually applies to
uh you'll pass by this sort of like crossing
people in national service <cs/> sometimes it applies to er people and the working like scenario also so
act blur is like pretending to not know something when you actually you know like you know like for example like
er i was given assignment by my supervisor to do like this this
task x yah let's say
but he he announced it in a meeting but you know i'm
i i just like choose not to answer or or or what act blur so i choose not to
know than o overly know that you know i have a task to do so when the day er like deadline for task x come up ah you know the oh i i i didn't know that i have such a task you know ah oh did you did you say such a thing no ah yah yah so this is act blur
but there'll be no cars usually the car won't drive past there they will usually make u turns so you can just walk past there then you just keep walking down
uh act cute yah
it just literally means like someone trying to like act really cute yah eh it usually applies to to like girls yah who who try to you know talk in like squeaky voice like
yeah i do uh
er yah so
usually when when
when people see that usually it's from a third party perspective so is like uh like you and me we're sitting here and then like the opposite table that there's this girl over there whose like act er like doing like this kind of things to some guy then i'll be like
er you know look at the girl
yah yah
so action yah uh
action usually is is also another like exclamation to use to like uh disapprove of what somebody does so like
uh for example if a a a guy comes up to the stage to do a speech you know usually people walk in walk walk to the stage to do a speech maybe he somersaults
uh you know across the stage and then he lands right in front of the podium to do the speech so when he does that people will be like sitting at the audience like wah this guy action ah you know like like trying to like
such acts such behaviour
and i think you can see coffee bean
it's not really necessary so there hence action
yah
yes
yah agak agak basically is uh estimation yah it so it's like
you know the like during perhaps during exams you know uh when we we are done with the exams then you know group of local students outside discussing
so so maybe one of them ask eh how how did you do like this er question five and then the other guy will be like oh i just agak agak er you know
throw in the formula
add the numbers in you know and get the answer so
er it's like a rough rough estimation
er how o of how people do stuff yah it applies to a lot of things
like not not even like studying like it can be
maybe at while we're waiting for a bus eh how long will bus come ah agak agakr maybe like
ten minutes yah estimated ten minutes yah
yah sure yah alright right glad to help thank you
okay er koufu it is basically the same thing it's just you have to walk straight for a long time so uh what you do is uh you can either choose to take the elevator or you can choose to walk down the stairs so
uh if you want to take the elevator you just need to
pass coffee bean turn left
uh and then there'll be a row of like benches faced er to the side
of the path and then just walk down straight
and then there will be elevator so you just take the elevator down to the lowest level
i think eh is it lowest or second lowest
uh second lowest
and then you'll be
the bottom if you choose to take the stairs then you have to
walk out of coffee bean
turn right you'll see like flight of like zigzaging not zipzaging ah but jagged stairs you know like so you just walk walk down the stairs all the way
so comparing those two areas right you you come down by the elevator you'll be like to the right side of the long path down the koufu
you come down by stairs you'll be on the left side
both are the same you just walk straight down and if you are on either side just walk straight down all the way you will pass by some l er l ts er
and then finally you will see uh
the lee kong chian lecture theatre the lee kong chian l t there's like a very nice looking l t yah
so when you see that uh
you can there will be a s a flight of stairs down so just take the flight of stairs down
and then once you reach the end of the flight of the stairs you just
do a u turn
you will c you can see koufu
er koufu basically is like a
uh what what they call a a
um you want to say it's not a hawker centre but it's it's more of like a foodcourt
food court yah
so you you can see a lot of this uh around singapore uh in the shopping centres there there's like food republic and and all that so koufu is actually one of those
companies ah that that operate foodcourts around so
they did this kind of foodcourts they usually cater food to everyone's taste yah they try to cater to everyone's taste so that that that's why you see there's like
there's like indian food there's like there's like malay food there's there's chicken rice
chinese food there's the mixed vegetable rice you know got all the ingredients there and there's like noodles laksa western western food there's pasta there
and all that yah
okay er
i think a really nice one would be fried rice
because uh
mo most of the time the the i think
the western uh students from western countries they they seldom have
like exposure to fried rice e even if you know that there's like other exchange students from
from a other asian countries that there's like different varieties of
fried rice so maybe the local one might might taste different
might have different taste because i myself i like to try like different varieties of
fried rice there's there's no one type of fried rice there's so many types there's like uh
salted fish fried rice there's like
uh also i i can't even the recall there's there's just too too too many eh then there's like silver fish fried rice
yah sil silver fish is like
is is a
i i want to call it ikan bilis but is but is not it is basically like a really small like white s fish you can eat you can eat the whole whole thing because they they fry and then it's so crispy you can just yah eat the whole thing
oh okay uh
the english word for ikan bilis right is actually an anchovies yah so it is really just small fish that
uh how they cook it in the local style is that usually they will deep fried it
so it's really crispy you can just you know eat the whole thing and
yah it's very crunchy yah
uh i used to do that but now not really because it will give me like sore throat and all that so usually i have it with like um rice or or or usually they come they come with uh nasi lemak yah
uh okay nasi lemak is actually uh a malay cuisine malay food so uh
i think the literal translation is like i think lemak is
fat or something yah and and and nasi is rice so er why why there's f like lemak there's like fat i think is because of
they when they cook the rice they they cook it with coconut milk yah so
there there's this like aro very nice aroma very nice uh smell in it
but but it's a kind of fattening so ppc yah yah and and they they accompany the rice with
quite a few ingredients there's they accompanied with yah like what what i said just now ikan bilis peanuts
uh fried chicken yah usually the fried chicken wing yah they taste really nice and sometimes they
they pair up with a fried fish the ikan kuning yah
ikan means fish in malay yah so kuning is uh is a
type of fish yah it it it is i think it's around like this this big so
usually they they fry it with like turmeric or something so so that it will look a bit like yea yellowy orangy yah but but it's really tasty because uh
yah it's deep fried yah yah yah and and the good thing about nasi lemak also is er because it it comes with
sambal which is chilli
yah and and the chilli is like a there's a tinge of sweetness to it so you you mix around with it you can mix it around with the ingredients with the rice it it tastes good ah and and they end it off with
cucumber so af after you feeling wah really spicy and hot eh y y you can just eat the cucumber to cool yourself down
yah
yah yah i i eat that often
oh noodles okay uh
let's see
mee rebus can can also be a good choice because uh
it is it's just yellow noodles uh
cooked in like i think in a some kind of like sweet sauce ah they they uh no i'm sorry they cook the noodles first and then i think they pour that sweet sauce thing over ah i i last time when i was i was young ah i used to drink the sauce yah it it's very like savoury but kind of fattening also at the same time ah yah and u usually uh
mee rebus they they have
if i'm not wrong they have like uh
hard boiled egg inside oh yah i i forgot to say nasi lemak also has egg but but it's fried egg yah
yah er for mee goreng is boiled egg because i think it is not really er suit suitable to have fried egg in a soupy soupy dish yah
so they they will have like f a boiled egg and i think some some chicken in inside if i'm not wrong and they have like those like tau pok small small
tau pok inside
yah and and and they have like i think they put some veggies like i think is it coriander or s or something yah
the the v the veggies uh add abit of crunch
to the noodles and then add add a bit of like refreshing taste also
yah yah
okay uh indian food ah
well uh
i think uh nasi briyani you know ah it is a nice er indian food because i i eat that quite often
they they they have the same around the same name as er malay food like nasi briyani i'm not sure why that's the case but
it's indian food but yah so
the rice that they use is different from the the normal rice in nasi lemak they use uh basmati rice i think yah so it the grains of basmati rice they are quite long
so they looked very unique ah they they the first time the first time when i saw them i saw it i thought it was
like uh
how to say mee siam or or yah yah that was cut up really fine mee siam is is a kind of like rice with er vermicelli then yah yah
it is rice that and they usually accompany with uh curry chicken
er and if some some people they don't really like curry chicken so they they can like have have the option of like fried chicken yah but but the thing is that
the chicken is so big yah especially when
when you have the drumstick
yah the drumstick is like so big
every time i i save it for the last you know i i slow slowly eat the rice because uh other than chicken they they have it with uh
sometimes they give you a piece of cracker yah uh
is is uh
i don't know what's that call but but that cracker has like some spices in it so when when you eat the cracker you know there's crunchy and then there's some spice taste inside yah
so i usually eat the rice with cracker then they have like some
salad uh what how i put it salad yah and some cucumber maybe some onions and all that
so nasi briyani is the rice itself is quite
tasty already by itself you can actually eat it on it's own because they
they cook it with spices and and some other seasoning i am i i remember like i seen some kind of seed inside but i don't know what is it called
i think i saw star star anise yah kind of like herb inside also so
some herbs and spices so the rice itself has quite a nice taste
alright uh
okay i might not know all of them so i i'll try to like explain everything
kay eleven b er yah is is a national service lingo basically eleven b is uh
identity card for all the full time national servicemen who who do their national service as you know all male singaporean males aged eighteen they have to serve
yah their national service so they'll be exchanging their identity cards with this particular er card by itself which identifies them as national servicemen ah
yah four d uh basically is uh
it's a kind of a betting er system in singapore uh
it it just means four digits i think because people usually line up at the the betting uh
betting place and then they usually placed their bets on like four numbers that that were open er every
wednesday saturday and sunday yah i i don't do that but i have like relatives will do that often so yah yah and five cs ah is a
is a local like slang for the five cs that
or a guy usually they they they refer to a guy ah who must have it in order to be successful or or to
or to like marry someone in singapore yah
yah yah a car
yah car is really expensive in singapore condominium
cash credit card
and country club membership
hi
oh just now er i came from school i stay in the hall
er i have one more paper next monday
er currently in accounting
yah it was my first choice
oh okay erm okay so like previously right cause normally on a normal basis right i like to do like a lot of community service ah so i was thinking of doing social work as erm yah but then like after like i talk to a lot of people and like even like s current social workers right then they were advising like
i'm s like still quite young lah so like then they say like it's better not to go straight and and start out as a social worker because like we all know that like social worker like their hours are long then like they don't get paid very high also unless you really have the like burning passion in you which you think can last for very long right then like you really shouldn't go for it lah like so like she say like since i remember this social worker once told me that like she is like
singapore is quite a practical society right then like you should
actually do something more practical first then like when you are more stable your financial you’re financially more stable right then you move on to the social service sector in the future lah because like erm you don't really need like a social work degree to actually help people lah like you can actually help it like at your own time anytime when you are free even when you are studying also so like she say it's better like you can get school on and do something more practical first so i was like thinking through like a lot of different courses i know that i i definitely won't want do engineering cause i've done research before and i really don't like it then like other aspect like science and i thought like er after j c i thought enough ah science is that's it ah no more science already lah don't really like it also then like i'm not very language person also so then like i'm better with numbers ah so i know like accounting would be a better choice lah yah so after i thought so long then like i thought i might as well just try for accounting ah like uh a lot of people ask me then why don’t you just go for business ah but i i was thinking like
different things ah yah be it like how to interact with people or be it your
paperwork and stuff yah
s yah no more ah now because very obvious to me also lah
yah he really like just scolded me for it you know then i was like wow
so shock
yah i i was like i remember the exact word he said to me was like this space for who for me is it wah i was like i shock ah i didn't even know how to re respond to that ah
it's just every day scolding about like how bad my paperwork is and stuff lah
um yah got lah got lah i mean like
we have to move on with life lah no point like y you remember about this kind of bad things all the while because like even though like i didn't feel like he was a good superior but at least
i don't deny that i did learn things from him lah like you know how you deal with people and stuff
and h how you should present yourself ah because he was telling me like
i remember at the end before i left right he told me like
he was always very harsh on my paperwork because like he say subsequently when i go uni
i will understand why lah which i did understand now lah so like even though like actually two weeks back we there was a co cohesion and i met him like we still talk like normal then like everything was
okay lah yah because like
no matter how bad some things are right like there's still always a a positive outcome to it it just a perspective of life lah yah
and at at the end yah lah during that time when you never lah but in the end yah he did he still did lah
yah sometimes i will lah like is like oh my god what like my friends they are formatting but then i i will just like er at the end i'll just t tie up all everything myself lah because like this not army lah or i won't scold them or anything lah right i just do it myself lah yah everything is fine lah
m b s friends i won't say no lah
but because like school school started only fourteen weeks ago lah like i won't say like they are so close until i mean i do have a group of close friends lah but
but m b s you know everyone is busy with their own life and not really ah but i did rope alot of my j c friends in to go with me lah yah so like sometimes i volunteer lah and we will meet and then meet there also like a catch up also as you as you do volunteer work ah because now everyone is dispersed already what yah so so so quite nice when you see them coming back also yah when you actually see your friend coming back together to volunteer with you so quite a nice feeling lah
oh er okay i've okay for me right like
i take quite a personal stance like in a sense that i try my to tell myself that i do not want to be too personal to them ah because like
as you know like
no dinner last forever lah so like at the end right like you have to part also lah so like i don't want to end up parting where everyone like very sad then emotional and then breakdown and cry and stuff lah because some of some some of them really will do that you know so like i told myself right like i will just like
befriend them but like i don't want to get to personal to them also lah there's always my stance lah so like but then like it's als i feel like it's just just nice also because like even subsequently when they come back they still recognize you then they will still talk to you
and say hi to you yah so i thought like
currently like i'm at a quite okay stairs ah like where the line is drawn just nice ah yah
oh oh wow okay i didn't know i talk so long
what an accounting student can do right
a business student cannot do but uh what a business student can do right an accounting student can do also lah so like if i do accounting is more like
two in one also like s it makes more sense ah to me lah yah so like after all these consideration i thought for quite a long period of time then i decided do accounting
oh okay so like back then in my school in my j c right like
uh every c c a lab and class right actually like every year we have to do c i p one it's compulsory for us ah yah so then after that my c c a i remember then like my vice president he managed to link up with y m c a then like we started to do a c i p together ah then subsequently from then onwards right even though after i graduated even until now right i will still continue to do lah because like i found that i really enjoy what i'm doing enjoy it really serving the community and helping people lah so yah
er okay so like erm because now currently right i do with quite a lot of different organisation also ah but for like let's say for y m c a right so y m c a part right i'm not not really say volunteering now already i'm more of like in the planning committee so like i always help to plan like the all the events organisation not not organisation sorry the event and all the i'm in the organising committee ah so like and then i help to plan all the events then have to recruit volunteers in already because like after you are you volunteer with them for quite some time then they will usually want you to come and help them with all their planning and stuff also so for a y m c a side right i more of helping to plan events now already rather than actually volunteering already which is also quite nice because like sometimes right you will see that regular volunteers also will keep coming back then they will slowly subsequently they also start to join you onboard to help plan events then it's quite a nice feeling also ah yah then for my other
organisation part like recently i also join like this organisation called health serve i'm not sure whether you know about is it helps like all the foreign workers that are currently like
this they suffer injuries during work then they cannot work now so like what health serve does is like they give them free medical services
to help them like treatment and then like they help them if they are get incur in some law lawsuit because of their injury but then like their superior though doesn't want to pay or what then
then they will help them to find lawyers also and like
have to help them settle because like when they come all the way to singapore they don't have any family or what they are also very lo they are at a loss ah so but for my part because i'm not like medically trained or anything so what i also help to do is also like occasionally plan events for them
like more of them just need to be there to be their friend you know to accompany them talk to them so that they don't feel like lonely ah because like when they don't work also right they really don't have anything else to do they just like read every time all the while have nothing to do lah yah but recently finals ah so like now tone down a bit lah yah when ah subsequently i'll start continuing soon ah
currently year one
probably lah yah so it's it been like since j c even during my army time
cause honestly like it doesn't really take that much of a time right like at most every saturday you just go do something yah for a few hours only like
it's all how much time you're willing to commit lah this
from school last time yah
y yah because like back then in school right usually cause you know got c i p hours then last time you always do for the sake of doing for the hours ah but then like subsequently for me at least ah like i found that i really actually enjoy it rather than just doing for the sake of the hours ah which is quite pointless lah then so even though until now i will still conti continue doing lah because like it really the satisfaction is there lah when you see that people really enjoy what you do for them yah
er in hall not really lah hall hall life ve very tiring also ah but as in for n t u side i also recently i just join w s c side lah yah um i went to join the deaf community to learn sign language also too
so like subsequently next year onwards also i i will be teaching deaf students tuition also
previously before i came uni cause like you know got a long period of waiting time then i went to learn ah but then after that when i found out that like n t u also got the deaf community there i join them then they also send us for sign language classes also lah so recently all the classes just ended then
then next year onwards we will when we teach the deaf student then
you will use it more already lor
ah yah okay lah
oh er f currently for now ah my plan is that i will just be an accountant for like a few years then until like i feel like i'm more financially stable already then subsequently in the next time i maybe then go over to the social service sector
but then of course when during my time as a accountant i was still like free time ah just go and help also lah because like no harm or what yah
that one s maybe next time lah sees when we got time then see how lah yah because like really lah you don't really need a paper certification to help you unless you really want to be like a full time social worker or what then yah you need lah but for now it's more i just wanna
volunteer and help people ah because like
i also know that like sometimes right your passion cannot really pick your career lah because once it becomes your career right
it's a whole new ball game already lah like it will change lah a lot of things to change ah
i won't really say every moment but it's more of like usually at the end of a like an event ah or what because like some if you go back often right you realize that as in the beneficiaries of course they will recognize you ah so then like sometimes at the end right like
at the e when they just come to you right and then like some erm they just like some some of them like young kids especially then they will just like hug you and then say thank you kor kor something then like wah that moment is like your heart will be like wah melt already yah but other than that i won't say there's a like major event that like impact me lah it's more of like usually at the end you know
a simple thank you like is good enough already ah
usually as in currently right for me now right i trying to expose myself to the different kind of
different groups yah you get what i mean right so like i have helped like young kids uh then the poor and then the blind and then currently doing the deaf also the elderly also then like more or less i feel like
oh okay lah but i just realized that i really cannot interact with elderly ah that's my conclusion ah so like it's not say like i don't want to help them or what but
i just got nothing to say to them you know like i remember this moment that i was just sitting at a table with another volunteer
then the other volu that volunteer also quit new then we were with a whole table of elderly right then like both of us just like awkwardly sitting there like didn't know what to say you know then like because like it's not very nice you just talk to one or two of them then you neglect the rest as in like i don't really know how to like engage a group of elderly then because there's sometimes right elderly tend to be more sensitive then like i'm also afraid of like saying the wrong thing yah so like usually right now right like if i can right i would avoid working with elderly lah it's not that i don't want to step out of my comfort zone but i've tried but like it just doesn't didn't work out lah so like
besides elderly most of the time i've exposed myself to most group already lah then like
even foreign workers also now so like yah
okay ah most of them
i'm okay with most of them ah
yah as in yah it's not it's not that i'm not okay with them like if sometimes if they ask me to go and help elderly i will still go lah but usually if i can ah i will just not go lah pplb because like i really cannot interact there's just um maybe generation gap or something ah i just can't ah
then some of them like when they speak like hokkien to you then like you also understand then yah then the language barrier also there
yah
yah then like sometimes i understand but i don't know how to reply them you know like
er hall b ah usually i like to run lah on my own ah but er not not like on a competitive basis ah like own lei lei leisure run then sometimes run marathon here and there free time yah nothing much lah then if not means at home watch watch dramas or stuff lah
yah but in hall in my hall i just play hockey ah but
uh bef bef bef before uni i didn't have any like experience ah i just want to try something new also so yah other than that yah that's it lah
wah okay er my army life ah i would say like
it's fulfilling lah uh yah because like
my whole of year one i was like really just doing like all the combat training like always go in the forest like almost
half half of the time is in the forest one ah then
lots of training then everytime get scolding then like it's quite like physically and mentally draining lah but then subsequently in year two when i
commission already because i was in a officer ah so then yah commission already right but then they posted me to h q ah uh headquarter there then i do a lot of paperwork so then it's more if if because er like a totally different story because like what you learn how to fight in a forest is not relevant in how to do the paperwork ah so like but then like the good thing about my army life i feel like i was there i learn both the hard skill and the soft skills lah so like you
like hard skill wife like maybe like all the i i'm better at excel now and words like how to do all the paperwork
but then like soft skills uh you really learn how to like
deal with people lah like cause you really meet all kind of people be it your superior or your or your guys below you lah like you learn how to take a different approach
to to to different people ah because like some people right
even though like army people always think discipline discipline but some people obviously they clearly don't care one ah yah some people don't they they just don't bother one ah so like you need to find like many different ways to approach them like if you want to get them to do things scolding doesn't always help you know like
you you need to find like what's the right way to approach them some of them like
it's better if you can approach them from a friend point of view but rather some of them like y some of them it's just like
y they they don't really want to help you no matter what one ah so like you really need to see how to work your way
around things lor yah
yah then like when you talk to your superior also like some of them just very anal about things you know like i remember once my superior right like
my document i submitted like s my report to him lah then then after that he look he he call me to his office right then after that ask him yah so um is there any wrong thing wrong with my thing lah then he pointed er to the to me it's like this this spacing lah in between two words right
then he ask me what's wrong
then i look at him i i don't see anything wrong ah then he say can't you this space so big for who he ask me is it for me then i say er no ah sir ppbl then you double space for what
then i was like
er okay sorry sir yah then i was like damn stun ah because like double spacing like i didn't even realise it notice it but he actually like noticed that i double space by accident then like he made me redo the whole thing and like reprint the whole thing then he scolded me for wasting paper cause i didn't my job properly but
i was just like my my thinking like if you are willing because he doesn't like to read softcopy he like to be hardcopy then i was thinking like if you were willing to read softcopy then like i wouldn't have to waste paper also right but then like
also my fault lah cause like i double space lah yah lah
yah cause he is very anal about like all the formatting and paperwork lah
yah so like you really learn you really meet all kind of people in the army lah then like i thought like yah so i really like learn a lot in army ah yah but like then in a sense also lah <c/ even though he was very strict on my paperwork i like right now it help lah because like you do a lot of reports in uni and stuff right then i now become very anal also ah then like at at the end of like reports right i will i will just tell my friends i will do your formatting ah because like become a habit already you know like all the s font size must be the same must be the same font spacing must be equal don't double space also yah it becomes a habit also then naturally so like i guess army really taught me a lot of
hello
um my name is izlin i am majoring in biological sciences with a double major in psychology
kay so for biological sciences we l mostly learn molecular biology so for this semester i am learning um genetics and cell biology bio statistics and then for
er psychology i'm taking i choose to
i choose to take up the course developmental psychology instead of social psychology
yah and also er statistics yah
yah it was my first choice entering into n t u yah
yah i had er n u s was my first choice but then n u s gave me my third choice which i wasn't really fond of so i decide to go with n t u instead
i used to kay ah for now i'm like to watch the office the tv series
cause it's very funny but now don't really have time because of commitments and studies cause semester two
but last time when i had time in j c i like to go rockclimbing with my friends
yah even out of training sessions yah
um not really just just rockclimbing
then after that um her roommate keep fishballs inside and fisballs can't last long in the mini fridge and it didn't of course it didn't smell good lah for so long and she kept telling her roommate can like clean the clean the fridge clean the fridge but and her roommate was like yah i clean already but actually the smell is still there it's erm abit abit er disgusting ah
yah
i yah she c i don't know whether she actually cooks inside hall also
yah
yah
yah they are they are friends even before also
so this year's o e we are called uh sangkum abadi and abadi
like in general or
okay let me think i think if she
i don't know f she
chose to
like have a lot of furry like
furry animals
because it's like collect dust and it doesn't really
and our hall is not even that big also and if she
if she i don't know put something very big right i i re obstructs me movement i'll be like okay i need more space get out that kind yah but so far i'm the one that's the messier one so yah
in er malay is everlasting and sangkum means hope in the c
oh no because we each have our one dustbin and each have our own laundry bag so is like we do whatever we we do what we have what is our own ah yah
oh i don't i don't mind cleaning the room on my own it's like whenever i'd i mean it's not until to extent that i clean the window because i mean it it doesn't like i cannot see it so it's okay right so it's mostly the floor because we have a lot of hair then we like keep our hair keep dropping so we just so i will just like whenever i there's a lot of hair then i will just um i'll just wipe it ah which i don't mind ah because it's also a good habit to pick up yah
yah
yah she's neater than me so yah she's neater than me
okay
khmer language it's the cambodia language so it translate to er everlasting hope and i mean the programme's department where we plan the bulk of the education and the construction there
so we have er we so we are planning act to teach them english maths science and mostly we are teaching grade one to six for the first part of the trip and then after that it's uh younger kids for the second part of the trip yah
because in the am the malay culture society perbayu right um o e was the only one which was humanitarian which want will which was helping the kids ah and i know i was going to be heavily involved since it's a overseas expedition but then i wanted to try something new because last semester i was quite bored with just studying yah
so i i hope to um be more grateful with what i have and open my mind to more uh opportunities and because for me i am more or i'm not the kind that will take risks so i hope i'm hoping that with these o e i will take more risks during their trip and even after that also
yah we have mostly b the bulk is proposal but i don't mind because ever since in secondary school i enjoyed doing these admin proposal work and planning because i don't really like
um i don't really like no not knowing what the programme is so i rather be in control of the programme and know and like give my maca uh like to
my two cents worth of what i want the programme to be like and how i think it should be because i feel like if i wasn't in the programmes' team then i would i may not like what i'm doing yah
yah
yah more of er knowing what i eh i have to do and in control of what i can do and whether it is beneficial for the kids or not ah yah
yah it's um to educate the kids and to because even though we have um how to say like the less advantage people in singapore is not as it's not as bad as the other countries like for example in cambodia because it's still in singapore we are still quite shelter and pampered because for our pre trip we have to also volunteer in another org in an organization like muhammadiyah or darul ihsan eh that kind of organisations with kids but then we realized that even the kids there even the
erm in even the people we talk to they're like the staff there are aware that the people in singapore are not as erm are not as disadvantaged as those in cambodia and they are given food they are they have proper education and proper clothing and all so um in singapore i won't say that the
disadvantaged are as bad as those a abroad so i ra i want to go there and actually experience it first hand yah
yah
big uh i think if i'm going with at least someone i'm comfortable with then i don't mind because i'm more of a people person and i need someone to lean on and uh i'm not the kind that will go on solo trips that like
will actually come out of my comfort zone and do all these things on my own because i want someone to be dependent on someone i can share with ah if i'm on the trip and if i'm going on this big kind of all the way to africa
then if it's with people that i'm comfortable with like family i don't mind going but if it's like new people that i don't i haven't met before then i'm not comfortable in going yah
i t is
yah personally to me i think it's maybe uh just
the development like
if even if you don't have these basic things i guess you would need to have a positive thinking and the government needs to learn how to adapt to the changing
changing climate of the world and actually dev continue developing instead of just staying stagnant at as a third world country yah
yah
i'm cause now i'm staying in hall so i rarely have the chance to interact with my neighbours or anything and my house is at the is at the area where it's like one corridor only has two units so i only have one other neighbour and i'm not mostly at home even though where even when i'm not in hall also i'm not at home like in secondary school or j c i'm rarely at home i'll always be in school so i rarely have the chance to interact with them so i would say that
er i don't really help because yah the i can't really help also at the same time yah
yah i have one other sister who is twenty nine now so it's a big age gap of nine years yah
uh no she's she's not married er but she's working
yah she stays with my parents
er she also not really close to the neighbours cause she
can be she's like me she's can be social she's sociable if i want to but the other like cause my neighbours are not the kind that will be sociable also like the other just the one other neighbor so if they are not sociable so i won't really go out of my way to like oh hi how's your day that kind so it kind of like mine is like bounce off kind of social yah
friendly
oh no cause the one other unit uh that is along the corridor is me is er we have the they keep changing so this is throughout my whole nine nineteen years is they are the third neighbor to live there already so before that was er um
it was another family also but we weren't really close cause they they stayed there and then they moved out again because we had lift renovation work and they will had and they had a baby so they didn't want to stay there for long but before that we were very close to this uh other family because they always when they cook right then they will give us some leftovers or yah and then they also cause their families also always come over so whenever their families come then we also know their families ah and they are very friendly people so yah uh we are very close to that neighbour because
erm i was in the same school as that neighbour also and she will
and whenever cause my i both my parents work and they have grandparents in that house so whenever after school i will actually go over to their house and like do my work or they would take care of me and feed me yah so that's like the nicest memory i have ah
yah
yah my parents are still in touch because they also still um i still stay in tampines and they also they also still stay in tampines so whenever they have weddings or any big gatherings they will invite my parents and yah hari raya also they will invite my parents yah
yah i think i'll continue being the bouncer also because i'm scared when whenever i become too friendly i'm scared that they will be like i'll be too intrusive into their life or cause even personally for myself if i'm not in the friendly mode i won't be i don't want anyone to be like oh hi how's your day i want people to give me my space yah so maybe like there are certain people that are like that and i respect that ah
i think because they are the ones that will be there when you're not around at home and your home is where you always go to and without without them i feel
you won't have anyone to rely on if there's a real there's a real emergency like for example if you're overseas or something and you need to water your plants or er you left something behind or you just suspect something wrong with then you can always count on your neighbours ah yah
yah
yah cause um
i think it's good that the government has put in the you know the racial quota only certain race can you up to a maximum quota and there are also
a lot of events that the g r c will organise er i think it's the g r c yah i'm not so sure but at the c c they will organise like oh if there's chinese new year coming around then they will oh chinese new year gathering or hari raya gathering or deepavali gathering so it's like this kind of um small not say small but smaller scale events for the neighborhood that can bring people together like f when my father is also er like an r c member
yah so he is also in charge of like organizing this thing and he pulls us along some time so from that also he can meet like people living around us and um we can meet our neighbours even though it may not be direct but at least it's within the same area
um maybe by going to the um events then maybe pulling
if i don't know maybe pulling my friends along also yah cause i do have friends who stay in the same area
en yah and actual and not just go ah but actually interact with the people there cause even though if you go also then if you don't interact then it's a bit um pointless so actually just go and interact and when you see the same few faces in the at the carpark or at the void deck or wherever then just say hi yah that kind of thing
yah
language barrier ah language barr not really because
only with the older people but my h d b don't really have that many
old people lah and
yah and most of them can speak english even if it's the most basic english so at least can still understand each other and stuff and even though they cannot speak english they can actually speak malay so it's like
nope so either way also still can communicate yah even though they are not malay they can uh still understand abit of malay yah
er f s how many month this sem and last semester
yah because i'm in year one so yah so
yah ever since the start of me entering uni i've been in staying in hall but then last semester i stay in hall twelve
alone like in a single room eh because i wasn't sure of how i would act i will how i would like it if i had a roommate because all along i've been living on my own
then i stay in hall twelve and i didn't really like it because
it was it didn't have any lift so yah so i and i stay on the seventh floor but then the first floor of like my where my staircase starts is at the fourth floor but bis because it's upclope to my hall so i didn't like the end there was only a laundry r one laundry room at the fourth floor so have to go all the way up go all the way up so it was quite tiring and i didn't like living on my own
yah and the hall twelve was very open like
there was it wasn't there wasn't any gender segregation so like the boys can co access can have access to the female block and the female will have access to the male block and even so right it's like a u shape and girls can see the boys' room and the boys can see the girls' room so it's like a bit of um i didn't like i didn't really like that was so awkward so i decided to go for tamarind which is like a more like
closed up and one level is one gender that kind yah
yah i have a roommate now
yah actually is like more fun with a roommate around because when i go home after school then i can talk to her about things then i can tell her my o e stuff also then she tell me what she did also during the day so it's like going home to a family even though it's only one person yah
er not really but when we passed by our neighbours then we'll actually like smile
because our neighbours also we don't really we don't know who are i who our next door neighbours cause we haven't really
see we don't see them often cause there're so many people on the floor so
we don't know who they are lah but we just smile to everyone who's on the same floor yah
as don't have any worries about living alone or with a room with a
yah i was scared that maybe um she will be the messy one or whether or maybe she wants things a certain way and then i didn't want it maybe she wants a room a different smell and i didn't like it because like a hall is supposed
yah your room is where you are supposed to be comfortable in and if i have to not
if i have to accommodate to her then it's a bit
er uncomfortable for me so but in the end both of us are actually like like minded and we know each other before that also so it wasn't really awkward or anything ah yah it's more fun ah yah
okay not didn't like ah but there was this my friend um she knows her roommate also like they're friends also but then erm like she likes to the roommate but there's one thing her that her roommate does that she get so annoyed it's like cause they have s mini fridge
