sgenglish00001-s001m-00351-00744 hey hi  i'm justine and i'm majoring in english literature
sgenglish00001-s001m-01047-01224 er yes  it was
sgenglish00001-s001m-01282-01384 yeah  it was
sgenglish00001-s001m-01484-02309 er because i really like literature and there's not much else i'm very good at  so
sgenglish00001-s001m-02508-02728 yes  i did all the way  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-03020-03732 i think it was compulsory in secondary school  then after that er it was interesting ah  it was more interesting than any other subject  so yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-03735-03840 i guess so
sgenglish00001-s001m-04079-04236 er year four
sgenglish00001-s001m-05262-05962 er yes  in my first and second year  i joined the school muay thai and brazilian jiu jitsu club
sgenglish00001-s001m-05986-06404 then uh in my second year also  i joined er acapella group
sgenglish00001-s001m-06431-06819 yah  and currently i'm only still in that acapella group
sgenglish00001-s001m-07195-07931 it's actually those unproper c c as  they're interest groups ah but er we meet once or twice a week and then we
sgenglish00001-s001m-07950-08461 uh and like s for those interested in fighting but
sgenglish00001-s001m-08464-08722 muay thai is a lot of er
sgenglish00001-s001m-08729-09519 kicking and punching whereas b j j is a lot of floor work  so you're hugging a lot of people on the ground  rolling around  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-09692-10166 no   not good but because the guy i liked was there  so i went there
sgenglish00001-s001m-100372-101736 oh erm oh they have this thing called er i think the correct term is midies  yah  where they separate the different parts  remember i was talking about the soprano  alto  all that  yah  so they er have er
sgenglish00001-s001m-101912-102467 like a  i won't say video  audio recording of each individual but which you can listen to
sgenglish00001-s001m-10196-10459 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-102479-103254 yah  and i'm more of a audio learner than a visual in this case cause i can't read notes  so yah  that helps a lot
sgenglish00001-s001m-103535-103679 correct  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-103831-103958 oh definitely
sgenglish00001-s001m-103977-104944 er i have to combine with the other people and sing together but i think singing together also is very important  yah  so
sgenglish00001-s001m-105040-105679 practice is very important  yes  both with yourself and with the entire group  yes  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-106375-106488 yes  that's right
sgenglish00001-s001m-107598-107854 personally for me  er
sgenglish00001-s001m-10769-10971 uh i think it's
sgenglish00001-s001m-107922-109123 well i mean for one thing it's finding the right people to sing with  people you want to sing with but after that also i think it's  translating er your normal singing into performance singing
sgenglish00001-s001m-109132-109921 yah  because uh singing to each other is very different from performing to a crowd of people  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-109934-110513 and that can goes back to that thing i was saying about  stepping out of my comfort zone because
sgenglish00001-s001m-11000-11313 quite hard unless somebody uh like
sgenglish00001-s001m-110517-110903 like for example  when i perform  i like to look at the floor  i dont like to look at people
sgenglish00001-s001m-110909-112708 cause it's easier to concentrate on my note when i'm looking at the floor but yah  so you've like maintaining eye contact  making sure you look like you're enjoying yourself or appropriate to whatever the mood of the song is  and if choreo is necessary  remembering your choreo but still singing properly
sgenglish00001-s001m-112718-112833 so yah  the the
sgenglish00001-s001m-112848-113286 entire performance aspect of acapella is something that is
sgenglish00001-s001m-113296-113596 difficult for me  yah  but
sgenglish00001-s001m-113847-113985 yah  er
sgenglish00001-s001m-11403-11834 it's not really self defence but it's a good form of exercise
sgenglish00001-s001m-114035-114733 but i mean that's the whole point right  to get better  so hopefully yah  especially the dancing part
sgenglish00001-s001m-114761-115010 thank you
sgenglish00001-s001m-115486-115978 er yah  currently i'm the welfare officer for the club  yes
sgenglish00001-s001m-116106-116756 er supposely lah  yes   yes yes  i try  i try  i try  yes  as a  as the
sgenglish00001-s001m-117604-117770 its very hard to
sgenglish00001-s001m-117791-120097 uh individually help everybody because er of the way the club is and i think it would be difficult or for them to want to approach me specifically as well because i'm sure they have their own problems  but er as much as i can like for example  we ce help celebrate their birthdays  we  organize bonding events for them and uh
sgenglish00001-s001m-11848-12311 but maybe cause i suck at it  if you're good at it  maybe you can use it in real life   yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-120127-120615 yah  but currently due to a lack of a concrete
sgenglish00001-s001m-120632-121134 er of permanent club room  i think like a lot of er what i could do  it
sgenglish00001-s001m-121145-121286 er cannot be done
sgenglish00001-s001m-121296-122208 yah  because we move  eh we have a room in the hive but uh i mean it's a common classroom  so we can't leave any of our stuff there
sgenglish00001-s001m-122555-122674 you're welcome
sgenglish00001-s001m-13137-13441 no  i would run
sgenglish00001-s001m-13680-14301 if i can help  can help orh but if not i would  it will make more sense to leave and get help from elsewhere  yes
sgenglish00001-s001m-15076-15272 yes  i stayed during my first year
sgenglish00001-s001m-15463-16059 er as in the hall life wasn't for me
sgenglish00001-s001m-16081-17169 uh it was very tiring and everybody wanted  was always doing something  you had to be doing something  or like in a lot of committees in order to ensure hall stay for the following year
sgenglish00001-s001m-17178-17787 and it just felt like a lot of effort for me and i couldn't have time to study or have time to myself  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-18060-18160 yah  it was
sgenglish00001-s001m-18179-18302 yah  correct
sgenglish00001-s001m-18654-19285 so like they have a lot of sub committees and committees uh for different events  so uh i had to join
sgenglish00001-s001m-19317-20878 a b hall block commitee  the sub comm  and then i had to join like their newspaper slash magazine sub comm also  and a whole bunch of different sports slash  er what they call them  games  there's what i think there was  er
sgenglish00001-s001m-20933-21349 what do you call that thing  there were darts  there was scrabble  there was boggle
sgenglish00001-s001m-21352-21732 got there was netball  there was volleyball
sgenglish00001-s001m-21745-22517 it's a lot and  correct and yah  i didn't have time at all to do my own work  yah  so it was very tiring
sgenglish00001-s001m-22644-22830 yah  it was  at night
sgenglish00001-s001m-23043-23273 oh my god  yah  every night
sgenglish00001-s001m-23284-23723 every night i'll be awake until maybe two or three easily
sgenglish00001-s001m-23729-23839 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-24459-25590 i still sleep at two or three sometimes but er at least i have more time to myself and more time to do the things that i really want to do  not just things i'm forced to do  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-25777-25964 like er acapella singing
sgenglish00001-s001m-25974-27060 okay  so er the acapella group is called harmonics  er it's very new  it's about one or two years old  uh
sgenglish00001-s001m-27089-27451 er what what about it would you like to know about
sgenglish00001-s001m-27538-29122 i mean we sing ah  er we we have different  we have like sub groups  each group has about maybe  six to eight people  then er we have our own repertoire  each group  and then we go out and do gigs
sgenglish00001-s001m-29129-29239 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-29720-29849 normal singing
sgenglish00001-s001m-29852-31533 er over one thing  acapella means er without i believe it means without instrument or purely vocals  so yah  that's one thing   then another thing is uh because i was from choir in secondary school and j c  is er and that has safety in numbers whereas acapella is one person per part
sgenglish00001-s001m-31539-31741 so that er
sgenglish00001-s001m-31747-32322 really causes you to have to believe in yourself and in your teammates  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-32358-32458 its a bit different
sgenglish00001-s001m-33124-33473 to be honest  i really hate performing  i'm very shy
sgenglish00001-s001m-33477-33902 uh up to now  i still don't really like it ah but uh it's
sgenglish00001-s001m-33929-34409 fun and enjoyable to perform with my teammates  so
sgenglish00001-s001m-34413-35425 that encourages me to step out of my comfort zone  so every time we perform  i'm stepping out of my comfort zone  but yah  but it's okay  because i'm not alone  they are there
sgenglish00001-s001m-35438-35580 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-36174-36307 correct  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-37040-37855 er i was a soprano in choir  then when i came to acapella  i they make me alto but then now they make me sop again  so
sgenglish00001-s001m-37869-38022 i suppose yes  same part
sgenglish00001-s001m-38286-39774 soprano  oh sopranos they have like different sections  this is from highest to lowest  uh soprano  alto  tenor  bass  and then in between they have like mezzo sop  which is like in between soprano and alto and baritone which i believe is in between tenor and bass
sgenglish00001-s001m-39785-40169 yah  so it's just different sections for your vocal range  yes
sgenglish00001-s001m-40344-40585 you
sgenglish00001-s001m-40620-41424 play a keyboard and if you can hit the note  i suppose that is your range   i'm not a musical person
sgenglish00001-s001m-41623-42513 i think it's highly recommended that you have musical background but yah  it definitely helps ah  like reading notes and stuff but no  i don't have musical background  yes
sgenglish00001-s001m-43156-43664 this will take a very long time because i need think about   there are a lot of performances  um
sgenglish00001-s001m-43793-43905 um memorable
sgenglish00001-s001m-44176-44697 i think last year we participated in this thing called acapellia art
sgenglish00001-s001m-44784-45094 acapella championships  it's like a
sgenglish00001-s001m-45156-45737 er open thing ah  there're different categories but basically anybody can join  yah  and
sgenglish00001-s001m-45755-46769 er we didn't train for very long  we train for like less than two months i think but there was something special about that group  yah  and i
sgenglish00001-s001m-46772-47449 it was very thrilling but also very scary because there was choreography  and if there's one thing i cannot do  it's dance
sgenglish00001-s001m-48174-48381 ah okay  yes
sgenglish00001-s001m-48391-48736 not dancing
sgenglish00001-s001m-48856-49123 alright
sgenglish00001-s001m-49179-49405 er i like to read
sgenglish00001-s001m-49415-49922 yah  i like to watch movies  yah  and
sgenglish00001-s001m-49939-50097 i like to spend time with my dog
sgenglish00001-s001m-50123-50265 yes  i have a dog
sgenglish00001-s001m-50287-51366 okay  so she's a west highland terrier  which kinda looks like that er snowy from tin tin  yah   but she's not very white  she's very brown because she likes to play in the mud
sgenglish00001-s001m-51373-51644 yeah  so she's er seven years old this year
sgenglish00001-s001m-51900-52646 er dog years  so she's like middle aged  she's like forty nine  eh seven human years  so for in dog years  she's forty nine  i think
sgenglish00001-s001m-52657-52762 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-52987-53176 yes
sgenglish00001-s001m-54070-55237 er i like yoga i suppose cause like i have anemia  so that means if i do anything too quickly or too strenuously  then i get dizzy
sgenglish00001-s001m-55240-55407 so i can't do much
sgenglish00001-s001m-55411-56502 but i do like to exercise  i really enjoyed muay thai and b j j  yah  but just that the company in harmonics er is a lot more enjoyable  so i picked
sgenglish00001-s001m-56507-56951 acapella singing over the other sports clubs in school  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-57466-58057 er yah  also because er i think practices fall on the same day  that's one thing
sgenglish00001-s001m-58074-58342 and another thing is er
sgenglish00001-s001m-58348-58857 yah  i re needed to juggle school work as well  so to choose two out of three
sgenglish00001-s001m-59296-59648 is er grades er that's not something  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-60124-60328 oh my god  er
sgenglish00001-s001m-60441-60666 yah  no actually no
sgenglish00001-s001m-60716-61051 it's probably sleep too much and then the other two suffer as a result
sgenglish00001-s001m-61359-61554 i know but what time do i wake up
sgenglish00001-s001m-61576-61824 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-61989-62820 er any time between seven to twelve  eh er seven a m to twelve p m  depending on whether i have class or not but yes
sgenglish00001-s001m-63225-64720 on weekends ah  er oh cause uh actually i currently only have two days of school  so i give tuition to this boy five times every other day that i don't have class   so i on saturday and sunday at about eight a m  i have tuition ah  so i have to wake up early on weekends
sgenglish00001-s001m-64971-65080 yah  correct
sgenglish00001-s001m-65173-65300 er english
sgenglish00001-s001m-65351-65519 er primary two
sgenglish00001-s001m-65534-65649 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-65907-66604 so like he's from his family is from mainland china  they moved here a couple of years ago   so er
sgenglish00001-s001m-66607-67953 my job is to inculcate the interest in reading in him ah   yah  so uh i won't say it's  it okay  it's not easy but he's er  it's really up to the students' like
sgenglish00001-s001m-67965-68607 attitude towards er receiving the learning  and he's not bad  like he's quite receptive and he's quite smart
sgenglish00001-s001m-68615-68809 but he's very lazy   so
sgenglish00001-s001m-68844-69041 pros and cons  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-69691-70232 for example  he will complain  like every time i ask him to do something  he will complain but er
sgenglish00001-s001m-70239-70342 i guess it's
sgenglish00001-s001m-70409-71463 a mixture of like letting him complain a bit because i mean you've been there before  you understand how you don't want to do something  but er also encouraging him
sgenglish00001-s001m-71466-72240 like especially when he gets something right  like he respond very well to positive feedback  yah  so that's been helping
sgenglish00001-s001m-72681-73155 yes  i am stereotypical literature student er
sgenglish00001-s001m-73158-73353 job but yes  yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-73576-73739 er as in
sgenglish00001-s001m-73977-74926 i i didn't want to teach literature  so it would be j c but there's no demand for that currently  so i suppose  primary school  because i like working with kids
sgenglish00001-s001m-74943-75060 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-75885-76372 wow  personal question   er
sgenglish00001-s001m-76375-76676 ideally  i would think two
sgenglish00001-s001m-76682-77143 kids  yeah  one boy  one girl  ideally but you cannot control this kind of thing  so
sgenglish00001-s001m-77152-77252 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-77626-77991 no  i have a younger sister  yeah  that's right
sgenglish00001-s001m-78155-78259 fantastic
sgenglish00001-s001m-78267-78377 yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-78419-79795 i didn't mean that sarcastically   er  in the past when we were growing up  i think we fought a lot but after a certain point  i think after we she entered junior college  then we just became very close
sgenglish00001-s001m-79821-80514 yah  so we share everything and we talk about everything ah  yah  i mean we still fight  that's normal but yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-80698-81119 er she's actually in n t u as well  she is er wee kim wee major
sgenglish00001-s001m-81325-81937 er does she sing  no  but she dances really well  so the the one thing i cannot do  she can do very well
sgenglish00001-s001m-82121-82765 i think i think so  so actually is not fair   she can do both probably but i can only do one
sgenglish00001-s001m-83484-84178 it it's been twenty four years and nothing has happened for me ah but i guess yah  we shall see
sgenglish00001-s001m-84437-84731 oh my god  okay  yes  me too
sgenglish00001-s001m-85539-85654 yes  that's right
sgenglish00001-s001m-85774-86348 er yes  i am this year actually but with a different group of people   yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-87006-87603 as in you want me to compare last year's group with this year's group or in general  oh okay
sgenglish00001-s001m-88303-89546 for one thing  i mean personality  to begin with  is very important ah  if you all don't click on a certain level   then it's very hard to firstly find songs that you all wanna do together
sgenglish00001-s001m-89560-90789 uh because people have very different tastes and another thing is perhaps your working style is very different   maybe some people are more systematic  some people a little bit more unorthodox  then if cannot work together  then there are a lot of problems
sgenglish00001-s001m-91176-91295 okay  so
sgenglish00001-s001m-91312-91994 er when you learn scores or we learn when we learn songs  you can choose to learn er via a score
sgenglish00001-s001m-92007-92917 and all the parts are nicely er written out for you or you could erm make your own arrangement which er requires er doing everything from scratch
sgenglish00001-s001m-92921-93350 or it could be taking a score and tweaking the score also  so yah
sgenglish00001-s001m-93365-94303 uh that's one part when i mean unorthodox  i mean it's not following a certain set of instructions and another thing is uh how people learn
sgenglish00001-s001m-94351-94560 yah  so some people
sgenglish00001-s001m-94567-95418 er sit down and then they go through everything step by step but other people maybe er not consistent  yah  only
sgenglish00001-s001m-95659-95871 ah my brain hurts  like
sgenglish00001-s001m-95931-96103 it's as and when  basically
sgenglish00001-s001m-96108-96783 people work differently  so i'm by unorthodox  yah  if you're not the usual kind of learner  yah  correct
sgenglish00001-s001m-97129-97239 to be honest
sgenglish00001-s001m-97348-98154 i wanna say i am orthodox but i can't really read scores very well  so i still need help from my teammates
sgenglish00001-s001m-98157-98420 but luckily they're all very talented  so
sgenglish00001-s001m-98579-98697 ah thanks
sgenglish00001-s001m-99291-99561 thanks
sgenglish00002-s001m-01929-02417 uh i'm having a class erm right before this um session
sgenglish00002-s001m-02432-02647 so i was at the
sgenglish00002-s001m-02673-02858 er south spine
sgenglish00002-s001m-02986-03222 having um i accounting lesson
sgenglish00002-s001m-03408-03611 erm i in accountancy
sgenglish00002-s001m-03914-04072 er year two sem two
sgenglish00002-s001m-04487-04922 uh yes it is my first choice because erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-04932-05634 when i was in poly i was doing business admin so it's quite a general erm course
sgenglish00002-s001m-05643-06076 so from there i start to realize like what i actually like
sgenglish00002-s001m-06094-07197 because i tend to get to try different areas of business so after trying i realised that eh financial accounting is something i like because it is very erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-07209-07323 clear like
sgenglish00002-s001m-07373-07861 once you get it you get it not unlike the rest of the module like erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-07890-09213 a bit fluff i feel so i was like esh is this correct or is this wrong very subjective so i thought that ah accounting is what i want so when i was here in uni year one i realize that er it's a bit
sgenglish00002-s001m-09229-09463 different from what i expected
sgenglish00002-s001m-09490-09602 so yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-09715-09906 uh how is it different
sgenglish00002-s001m-09992-10301 what i learnt is way too in depth already
sgenglish00002-s001m-100007-100744 what we do in poly also but not that difficult but yah we also did like a lot of practice like you know all the things
sgenglish00002-s001m-100848-100976 so yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-101641-101971 i prefer working just that that experience is like
sgenglish00002-s001m-101999-102217 yah totally different
sgenglish00002-s001m-102244-102806 but the thing about that i prefer i decide what makes me erm decide to
sgenglish00002-s001m-102822-103684 erm go on to financing er to accounting now it's also because i feel that after that three years in poly i didn't really learn much is
sgenglish00002-s001m-10345-10770 too much calculation and yah that's all that
sgenglish00002-s001m-103709-103972 the uh that time i remember a year three
sgenglish00002-s001m-103997-104788 uh before we like erm decided where we want to go like either work or continue applying for uni erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-104800-105274 uni so we were sitting down in a group then we're like er okay
sgenglish00002-s001m-105306-105613 so what we actually learn from this whole
sgenglish00002-s001m-105655-106449 whole erm poly education then we were like don't know eh i think do nice presentation so we don't have like really a very
sgenglish00002-s001m-106473-106672 confident answer like oh
sgenglish00002-s001m-106680-107263 our steps is okay we learn statistic so okay we can use that our excel is very good you know
sgenglish00002-s001m-107265-107779 like skills part a bit we have no idea what to put there also
sgenglish00002-s001m-107781-108902 so this is what makes me like think that i need to go on to something that erm is more specialised so that i know that after i graduate okay this is
sgenglish00002-s001m-109016-109200 yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-109948-110496 that time i was like sixteen seventeen so i know i want to do into this industry like
sgenglish00002-s001m-110617-110933 the general <unk> more general costs
sgenglish00002-s001m-110960-111233 you don't have to make decision on like
sgenglish00002-s001m-111273-111783 where to go or what you want to do so we can get to try different style
sgenglish00002-s001m-112186-112648 uh yah i didn't want to make a choice then
sgenglish00002-s001m-112774-113781 if now i were to go back to that time or advise another person at my age i think is good to
sgenglish00002-s001m-113865-113983 think through it
sgenglish00002-s001m-114047-114183 because at the end
sgenglish00002-s001m-114195-115290 you unless you really know that oh you like marketing like all these to learn all these skills then you feel that it's very er subjective ah some people feel it's good because it force you to`
sgenglish00002-s001m-11431-12449 even though i have a lot lots of complain about this but i still love it lah like i can see myself doing it erm after i graduate
sgenglish00002-s001m-115314-115425 be more
sgenglish00002-s001m-115431-116821 er there's a lot of presentation for my course so we tend to work with different groups so we are very used to like working with different people er for every sem and every mod we work with different people so
sgenglish00002-s001m-116854-117555 even if changing environment or what it doesn't really affect us we can like adapt easily so i think this is one of the take away from my
sgenglish00002-s001m-117561-117881 course other than that i think
sgenglish00002-s001m-118182-118342 yes yes
sgenglish00002-s001m-12477-14352 because uh after i graduate i tend i plan to continue in this industry and also continue to see how i can improve myself in that area like see what i'm lacking in like the skills or what l'm lacking so i can continue to upgrade myself even after i graduate from
sgenglish00002-s001m-15129-16072 erm i don't really have a club that i joined but er i tend to take up like classes outside like previously during erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-16124-16306 my summer break
sgenglish00002-s001m-16337-17034 before that uh before this sem i was actually doing my erm internship i took an l o a so
sgenglish00002-s001m-17040-18421 while i was working erm from nine to six like during the weekend and after work i tend to have a lot extra time because unlike school we don't have to like erm bring work back home to do or what so i have more times
sgenglish00002-s001m-18428-18908 that's the time where i start to like erm learn more about other things like
sgenglish00002-s001m-19044-19160 insurance
sgenglish00002-s001m-19173-21272 i go for classes like to see like how come there's so many people so interested in this industry so i go for their classes which is like erm you don't have to pay up for anything but you just go for the lesson to have a feel to understand more about what people are actually talking about so that's what i tend to spend during my leisure time
sgenglish00002-s001m-21890-22983 at the start because it is six month erm internship it is my first time working for so long so at the start i still very feel very you know i enjoy and like you know erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-22989-23324 because t g i f is really t g i f
sgenglish00002-s001m-23358-23622 ya damn weekend you really like rest
sgenglish00002-s001m-23798-24727 erm starting really after three months right you start to feel a bit nine to six is like too long already even if you got nothing because erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-24744-26476 uh during working hours right you tend to have like sometime it's off peak hour so you have like erm more time for yourself but you still have to stuck in that office you know you have non like you cannot go anywhere you cannot keep visiting the pantry or the toilet so you <unk> just have to sit there then you realize that
sgenglish00002-s001m-26552-26854 when you knock of that time is already like
sgenglish00002-s001m-26869-27091 uh the sun already set
sgenglish00002-s001m-27120-28376 so you like you miss you really miss the sun you know like because in the morning like eight plus i will reach office then i think i will go out around twelve plus so that's the only time you get to feel the sun
sgenglish00002-s001m-28931-29411 yes yes otherwise you are like trap in that office like
sgenglish00002-s001m-29900-30042 yes yes yes
sgenglish00002-s001m-30097-31883 so right now is like even though you have lots of time like because i arranged my time table in the way that i only attend class in the morning i prefer morning class so after twelve plus i have my time like on time but you have to allocate time to your revision and all those catching up with the assignment all those
sgenglish00002-s001m-32573-34306 okay like for the class because erm like for one module i'll only attend like they make it in a way like we only attend class for three hours in a week yah so lesser time lesser class er seminar but more readings ah yes more time yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-34313-34637 to do reading yes own own revision
sgenglish00002-s001m-36257-36525 no i take like forensic science
sgenglish00002-s001m-36713-36960 interesting i don't think
sgenglish00002-s001m-37042-38047 it is interesting because you tend to learn way more than what you can absorb so at the end of the class you feel that oh you are overwhelmed by all the information
sgenglish00002-s001m-38281-39105 what i find it interesting after finals then yah you start to recall back what you learn then okay ah still quite fun like
sgenglish00002-s001m-39131-39344 but during that erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-39430-39987 semester itself you have lots of things to cope so  you don't really feel like
sgenglish00002-s001m-40081-40439 ya  ya
sgenglish00002-s001m-41423-41832 volunteered stuff i volunteered in c d a c
sgenglish00002-s001m-41852-42217 er some um c d a this uh
sgenglish00002-s001m-42246-43381 place where we tend to help like uh teaching the primary school the um less fortunate primary school student like in tutoring them in their work or what so there is once
sgenglish00002-s001m-43389-44070 er we actually have this you know every year we have these erm at the start of the year we have these erm seminar
sgenglish00002-s001m-44080-45613 prepared for secondary uh poly student darren and and themselves uh the student themselves so what this seminar is about is that to prepare them on what poly life is about because on from secondary school to poly a bit different
sgenglish00002-s001m-45616-46429 so we tend to like share with them what er they weren't ex expect from this uh education
sgenglish00002-s001m-46447-46636 and no erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-46682-47687 yah to prepare themselves ah so i get the opportunity to erm be the emcee for that seminar yah so i think that is the a very
sgenglish00002-s001m-47808-48015 memorable experience for me
sgenglish00002-s001m-48144-48380 too um
sgenglish00002-s001m-48751-48959 on and off on and off yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-49269-49526 travelled anywhere i like thailand
sgenglish00002-s001m-49560-49677 yah is
sgenglish00002-s001m-49699-49895 um within my budget
sgenglish00002-s001m-49961-50351 but at the same time it still can you know travel out of singapore
sgenglish00002-s001m-50388-50650 yes yes yes yes
sgenglish00002-s001m-51485-51697 i think is the people
sgenglish00002-s001m-51699-51854 um  like
sgenglish00002-s001m-51878-52007 you can feel like
sgenglish00002-s001m-52022-52604 when you are shopping the shopping is not the main thing is that how you interact with the seller
sgenglish00002-s001m-52619-52804 like they are always so
sgenglish00002-s001m-52865-53285 excited about something i don't know like you can feel that their
sgenglish00002-s001m-53299-53591 the level of energy they have is like
sgenglish00002-s001m-53610-54683 very high then i'm like are they always like that because in singapore you tend to see that people are more focusing on their cellphone or they just follow you around but you they are a bit
sgenglish00002-s001m-54765-54934 they don't look that
sgenglish00002-s001m-54992-55626 excited or passion about your arrival or anything they just oh you are here okay then er anything but
sgenglish00002-s001m-55632-56630 in thailand they will tend to i think it's the way they speak or what their tone is very high so you feel that uh their energy level is so high then you feel you can feel their
sgenglish00002-s001m-56669-56876 what are their excitement also
sgenglish00002-s001m-57328-57445 ah yes
sgenglish00002-s001m-57498-58694 that's what i'm thinking like er in year three i need to clear like erm two more u e so i'm thinking of either thai or korea korean language this two
sgenglish00002-s001m-58858-59491 wah so you clear what the level one level one for both which one you think it's manageable like
sgenglish00002-s001m-61034-61250 the wording right
sgenglish00002-s001m-61294-61616 um how you learn like you memorize or you just
sgenglish00002-s001m-63947-64363 oh like all the words just keep throwing at you er i see
sgenglish00002-s001m-65212-65399 okay
sgenglish00002-s001m-65494-65917 so you think after level one of two both the language korean and thai right
sgenglish00002-s001m-65943-66180 can you like apply it in like
sgenglish00002-s001m-66184-67002 in real life like you can you speak like proper like okay bit and pieces here and there like when people speak to you can you like understand a bit
sgenglish00002-s001m-68647-69298 so you plan to  continue which one like you prefer which one like if you were to take a level two
sgenglish00002-s001m-69491-69829 kor korea wow
sgenglish00002-s001m-71240-71387 easier to re
sgenglish00002-s001m-72309-72434 i see
sgenglish00002-s001m-72493-73134 uh so from what you explain right i look forward to that plus already like next time i'm taking them
sgenglish00002-s001m-73897-74034 yes
sgenglish00002-s001m-75401-75561 places i want to work
sgenglish00002-s001m-75627-75988 not much on that but places i want to visit any place like
sgenglish00002-s001m-76042-76714 beside the city area i'm more towards like sightseeing i prefer sightseeing and those rural area
sgenglish00002-s001m-76855-77057 away from city hm
sgenglish00002-s001m-78147-78549 either korea japan or taiwan these three
sgenglish00002-s001m-79166-79373 yes yes
sgenglish00002-s001m-79995-80201 i feel i not sure i think
sgenglish00002-s001m-80241-80372 er because
sgenglish00002-s001m-80403-80588 europe all these places like
sgenglish00002-s001m-80638-80869 a bit distant like i don't feel er
sgenglish00002-s001m-81084-81295 i don't feel a bit uh like
sgenglish00002-s001m-81313-81525 i can't relate to them i feel
sgenglish00002-s001m-81577-82461 yah but for asia wise i think our culture and the food we eat and all those i not sure i think i can relate better
sgenglish00002-s001m-82651-82767 yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-83687-84970 oh another thing is uh i prefer using chopstick  yah i need chopstick in like you know every meal or what like even if i'm eating rice then they are like eh how come you don't want to use a fork and spoon i'm like urgh
sgenglish00002-s001m-84987-85314 chopsticks is good  yes
sgenglish00002-s001m-86260-86374 yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-87785-88062 it depends eh like for me like
sgenglish00002-s001m-88088-88420 if i'm on my own i'm okay with anything
sgenglish00002-s001m-88449-88770 but i tend to follow the majority
sgenglish00002-s001m-88795-89409 ha depends on what people want to eat then i just okay i don't have a erm preference or what yah
sgenglish00002-s001m-89456-89574 no
sgenglish00002-s001m-91358-91636 poly um i think poly
sgenglish00002-s001m-91776-92187 for my course right it's different from i didn't know
sgenglish00002-s001m-92217-94390 this difference until i erm graduate from poly so this is what happened uh during poly uh for my course i'm doing business admin so we focus a lot a lot on like those marketing soft skills representation uh as compared to banking finance and accounting course they are more erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-94408-96780 book related like <unk> ah they emphasise heavily on finals like their paper but for us it's like our a huge percentage is focused on our presentation so we our lecturer will keep telling us like no the slides must be like er a lot of animation as dramatic as possible you know our presentation is like
sgenglish00002-s001m-96798-97382 we need to perform in class one to entertain like there's entertainment erm
sgenglish00002-s001m-97527-97889 marks yah component in that presentation so
sgenglish00002-s001m-97928-98248 i thought that you know i at school is poly is like that
sgenglish00002-s001m-98290-98655 yah so that's why that's why i was i keep saying like when
sgenglish00002-s001m-98673-98932 i entered uni the difference it's like wah
sgenglish00002-s001m-99005-100004 so different until i spoke to like erm my er accounting and banking finance erm peers then they are like er actually this is something
sgenglish00003-s001m-02871-03039 is it  are you asking right now
sgenglish00003-s001m-03349-03549 to get from north spine to hive
sgenglish00003-s001m-03582-04227 kay  right now we're at b4 of computer science block   so what you can do is that you just take a lift
sgenglish00003-s001m-04250-04478 up to the first floor
sgenglish00003-s001m-04544-04724 then um
sgenglish00003-s001m-04834-05511 walk out of this block itself  then when you walk out of this block  you turn left and walk straight all the way
sgenglish00003-s001m-05526-05845 you will soon see a nanyang auditorium or
sgenglish00003-s001m-05880-06300 a coffee bean   i think at that point of time  it's very easy for you to ask someone that was there
sgenglish00003-s001m-06309-06462 then um
sgenglish00003-s001m-06612-06908 to get to the hive  erm
sgenglish00003-s001m-06975-07261 you can just pass by the starbucks
sgenglish00003-s001m-07336-07637 and walk down the st f er a long flight of stairs
sgenglish00003-s001m-07694-08033 then uh walk straight  you were eventually seeing a lecture hall
sgenglish00003-s001m-08052-08357 i think it's a me  what i can't remember the name
sgenglish00003-s001m-08440-09097 but that lecture area is very iconic  like it has  big panels of glass
sgenglish00003-s001m-09120-09555 kay  so that that is very iconic  so  uh so when you see the
sgenglish00003-s001m-09580-09769 um lecture right
sgenglish00003-s001m-09789-10422 you just turn right  you will see a staircase that leads down  so you just go down the staircase
sgenglish00003-s001m-100204-100352 oh my god
sgenglish00003-s001m-103745-103928 um what singaporeans do ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-104071-104370 oh singaporeans like that always like to do this one thing
sgenglish00003-s001m-104383-104647 the first thing they see a queue  they will queue
sgenglish00003-s001m-104651-105104 they won't ask  sir  what are you queuing for  they won't ask  they see a queue
sgenglish00003-s001m-10473-10696 then afterwards you go around the staircase
sgenglish00003-s001m-105123-105757 the first thing that comes to my mind is not to ask  is that um there must be g free and good stuff
sgenglish00003-s001m-105778-105975 cause that's all singaporeans are all about  free
sgenglish00003-s001m-106021-106558 okay   so it's like they will just queue queue queue  then at the end of when they reach the start of the queue ah  they'll be like
sgenglish00003-s001m-106572-106818 er sorry ah  what what are we queuing for ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-106824-106982 then they'll get what they want
sgenglish00003-s001m-106983-107532 hm then they will leave satisfied  but sometimes they  they'll be a bit angry ah because they queue for nothing but they deserve it
sgenglish00003-s001m-107542-108347 so um they also like to some some weird behavior that singaporeans do is that they also like to use um their own singlish
sgenglish00003-s001m-108398-108601 so um
sgenglish00003-s001m-108845-109018 as you grow up
sgenglish00003-s001m-10900-11028 make a u turn
sgenglish00003-s001m-109021-109281 you were exposed to different type of
sgenglish00003-s001m-109298-109402 singlish
sgenglish00003-s001m-109410-109578 so let's say primary school
sgenglish00003-s001m-109590-109783 primary school ah  what they know ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-109786-109955 is they will know buay tahan

sgenglish00003-s001m-117314-117880 it's just to say that i'm very sure that it is the case  even if i have to bet things
sgenglish00003-s001m-117919-118065 that involved chopping
sgenglish00003-s001m-118166-118391 then uh
sgenglish00003-s001m-118456-118732 let's just go through this list of singlish
sgenglish00003-s001m-118746-119044 cause i guess singlish is a very big part of singaporeans
sgenglish00003-s001m-119071-119366 so um just
sgenglish00003-s001m-119405-119551 uh abuthen
sgenglish00003-s001m-119568-119684 is like
sgenglish00003-s001m-119995-120606 the more popular say is like  you don't say  so it's like it's like it's a given  like you should have known it
sgenglish00003-s001m-120654-121022 uh eleven b is um the pass that
sgenglish00003-s001m-121031-121614 uh we have to ho men have to hold on during their national service for the rest of their life
sgenglish00003-s001m-121657-122208 and uh for the first two years  they will be finding something else  not the eleven b but the pink i c
sgenglish00003-s001m-122248-122402 that a lot of people take for granted
sgenglish00003-s001m-12229-12435 then afterwards um
sgenglish00003-s001m-122418-122650 but uh anyway and the five cs
sgenglish00003-s001m-122666-123230 erm doesn't concern me  uh okay it <unk> not concern me uh fine  but uh what is it ah  condo  credit card
sgenglish00003-s001m-123782-124064 i don't know lah but the five cs  mayb do you know
sgenglish00003-s001m-124072-124636 i don't know also   okay  but anyway um  ah beng  ah lian right is like the equivalent of
sgenglish00003-s001m-124656-124983 um male gangster and female gangster
sgenglish00003-s001m-124984-125157 ah kua means
sgenglish00003-s001m-125318-125790 a bit sensitive  let's not talk about it because you are conservative  then uh
sgenglish00003-s001m-12566-13206 walking forward  when by the time you reach the lower floor of koufu  i think you will be able to see
sgenglish00003-s001m-125858-126144 an zhua right  it means that what's up
sgenglish00003-s001m-126197-126308 in english ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-126353-126468 ang moh
sgenglish00003-s001m-126486-126931 kay lah  sometimes you also don't call ang moh but ang moh refers to caucasian
sgenglish00003-s001m-127269-127435 itchy backside ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-127522-128132 it's not really doesn't mean that your backside is itchy  doesn't me your buttocks is itchy   it means that
sgenglish00003-s001m-128257-128402 you did something
sgenglish00003-s001m-128516-129008 that was necces not necessary and end up  you have to pay the consequences
sgenglish00003-s001m-129015-129121 i i think
sgenglish00003-s001m-129133-129383 so uh  g g
sgenglish00003-s001m-129439-129991 depends on the context they're saying  g g if you say in a game  it means good game
sgenglish00003-s001m-130169-130516 if you say to others that did something wrong
sgenglish00003-s001m-130530-130786 eh you g g already  it means that
sgenglish00003-s001m-130831-131070 good game  also good game but
sgenglish00003-s001m-131106-131289 in a way  it means that
sgenglish00003-s001m-131467-131607 you're in deep shit
sgenglish00003-s001m-131639-131748 so
sgenglish00003-s001m-131771-132248 uh but if you say that you can also say  i am g g home
sgenglish00003-s001m-132313-132582 it can also be interpreted  i'm gonna go home
sgenglish00003-s001m-13233-13444 uh you know the dimsum
sgenglish00003-s001m-132849-133011 it depends on the context
sgenglish00003-s001m-133579-133780 then erm
sgenglish00003-s001m-133886-134104 okay  then also shag
sgenglish00003-s001m-134169-134388 shag means tired
sgenglish00003-s001m-134497-134791 but it means something else on the dictionary lah
sgenglish00003-s001m-13468-13632 the dimsum thing  right
sgenglish00003-s001m-135269-135471 they will use that in their complaints
sgenglish00003-s001m-135480-135620 wah this one damn shag
sgenglish00003-s001m-135662-137111 then you like add a damn  so that it amplify because it's like apparently shag is not enough  they must put damn shag   so it's like yah  so shag is like  after you do something  wah i feel damn shag  it can be  it is like  i feel damn shag is like er noun
sgenglish00003-s001m-13653-13816 the dimsum basket
sgenglish00003-s001m-137116-137264 then this is
sgenglish00003-s001m-137408-137539 this shag me out
sgenglish00003-s001m-137557-137751 also can be used as a verb  so
sgenglish00003-s001m-137791-137970 uh depends on how you want to use it ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-13852-14188 yah  you the hive looks like that  so just walk towards there
sgenglish00003-s001m-14199-14327 but don't take the lift
sgenglish00003-s001m-14396-14543 because the lift is very bad
sgenglish00003-s001m-16218-16371 outside of n t u
sgenglish00003-s001m-16596-16728 not too far
sgenglish00003-s001m-16779-16943 you know boon lay  jurong point

sgenglish00003-s001m-17502-18870 then uh what i but i i like  honestly i like the don more but a lot of my friends they like the ramen there   so uh you if you want to have the both best of both worlds  they have this set  that gives you a mini ramen and a mini don
sgenglish00003-s001m-18903-19091 and a plate of gyoza
sgenglish00003-s001m-19103-19729 worth it  should try   so that that one is quite good   uh and there's another fantastic place if you're going the lunch time
sgenglish00003-s001m-19731-20004 go to there this cafe
sgenglish00003-s001m-20016-20184 beside ya kun
sgenglish00003-s001m-20285-20392 the place
sgenglish00003-s001m-20429-21335 okay  is it is sell lunch set lunch set  uh it's from i think eleven if not wrong or one two five  i not sure   but i know it ends at five
sgenglish00003-s001m-21364-21970 so  um you can just go and  the food there is actually very worth it  like erm
sgenglish00003-s001m-21986-22087 what did i order
sgenglish00003-s001m-22136-22743 i i <unk> like three times already  so  um i would say that the ingredients they use right
sgenglish00003-s001m-22777-22940 are very fresh
sgenglish00003-s001m-22963-23201 and i had their iced lemon tea
sgenglish00003-s001m-23221-23636 they they they give you the iced  tea right  is
sgenglish00003-s001m-23671-24222 it it tastes very different from any usual tea because it's it's kind of like expensive uh more expensive type of a tea
sgenglish00003-s001m-24227-24969 uh it's black tea lah  then um you just add your own the the amount of sugar syrup that you want  so that that is like you can customise to your same taste
sgenglish00003-s001m-24980-25566 uh one more dish i like from them that it's not under the lunch set is actually this  uh potato fries
sgenglish00003-s001m-25597-25957 with truffles salted egg sauce
sgenglish00003-s001m-25975-26204 legit  i brought to the cinema
sgenglish00003-s001m-26218-26364 wah so good
sgenglish00003-s001m-26382-26501 really you should try
sgenglish00003-s001m-26717-28091 yah  not not not  i mean it's normal lah  so  yah  so it's really very good but the uh their  the lunch sets right is very worth it  and they give enough ingredients  they give you plentiful and give you fresh ingredients and
sgenglish00003-s001m-28237-28377 yah  that time what ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-28402-28627 i think i had some seafood one  scallop
sgenglish00003-s001m-28687-29273 yah  the sauce is wah so good  i ordered the steak also   the steak was a bit erm
sgenglish00003-s001m-29307-29655 some parts not medium rare  some parts medium rare  so
sgenglish00003-s001m-29661-29969 still quite good lah  the sauce like yah  but you know
sgenglish00003-s001m-30035-30163 but the place very organized
sgenglish00003-s001m-30856-31136 y i assume that you'll be going from hive
sgenglish00003-s001m-31174-31483 so uh opposite hive  there's a there's a bus stop
sgenglish00003-s001m-31552-31893 um opposite in the direction of the koufo lah
sgenglish00003-s001m-31901-32027 so you'll see a bus stop
sgenglish00003-s001m-32042-32505 then uh what you can do is that you can actually take a bus one seven nine
sgenglish00003-s001m-32564-32937 and uh alight at the last stop because it will stop at the
sgenglish00003-s001m-32993-33169 boon lay bus interchange
sgenglish00003-s001m-33200-33649 so when you alight from the interchange  you are actually at jurong point already
sgenglish00003-s001m-33655-35013 so just find your way  uh for for the japanese food that i said just now  as i said it's actually at the basement the l the bottom basement   it's uh at this japanese street  so you go through that street  everything is japanese food
sgenglish00003-s001m-35050-35321 japanese food is the best  so um
sgenglish00003-s001m-35349-36180 then for the one that i told you about   that one is  don't know how to describe but i would assume that that was around like the second last floor
sgenglish00003-s001m-36239-36500 yah  it's beside ya kun
sgenglish00003-s001m-37750-37872 shopping ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-38114-38240 what do you want to shop for
sgenglish00003-s001m-38773-39553 hm  honestly i don't recommend though   uh but er i think boon lay is good enough  honestly like they have quite a number of
sgenglish00003-s001m-39675-40147 clothes  but but if you are willing to go further  go to like suntec  harbourfront
sgenglish00003-s001m-40166-41385 uh i mean vivocity lah  harbourfront  those are the bigger malls   uh if you want a street wear  go bugis street or some place you can sort or place that you can go is at the cit  tanjong pagar there  what is that place called ah
sgenglish00003-s001m-41543-42215 i can't remember what's that place  city plaza is it  i think city plaza but  what i know is that that plaza has arnold chicken
sgenglish00003-s001m-42254-42780 if you know that  ah then  yah that one actually sell quite a number of   their i think they're retailers
sgenglish00003-s001m-42827-43202 and they sell mostly female clothes  so eh i think it'll be quite suitable for you
sgenglish00003-s001m-43896-44221 er boon lay one er i assume you already know
sgenglish00003-s001m-44224-44614 so uh to get to the
sgenglish00003-s001m-44642-44819 bugis street is
sgenglish00003-s001m-44824-45319 just take uh the green line in your case from boon lay   all the way to bugis
sgenglish00003-s001m-45346-45680 or if you want to go suntec  you can also take a bus from
sgenglish00003-s001m-45837-46824 to suntec straight away  or you can walk from there if you want ah miss  it's very near   then uh if you want to go harbourfront  uh you probably have to
sgenglish00003-s001m-46906-47593 take to the buona vis buona vista and then just take the line straight down to harbourfront  it's the last station
sgenglish00003-s001m-47657-47913 yah  i think that's reasonably close lah  so
sgenglish00003-s001m-48341-48987 tanjong pagar  tanjong pagar is erm   it's a little bit bef  it's a few stations before
sgenglish00003-s001m-49002-49904 um bugis  so from boon lay to tanjong pagar is nearer then going to bugis because the tanjong pagar is in between tanjong um boon lay and

sgenglish00004-s001m-03926-04031 you
sgenglish00004-s001m-04247-04421 just walk straight down
sgenglish00004-s001m-04478-04670 you will pass by a
sgenglish00004-s001m-04705-04877 i think the printing
sgenglish00004-s001m-04909-05725 some printing shop to your right and then you walk  just keep walking straight down  you will pass by the bus that that convenience store
sgenglish00004-s001m-05802-06545 keep walking straight  you uh that there'll be this like open plaza thing  there's a giant t v down there  you can't miss it
sgenglish00004-s001m-06736-06998 on the left  i think there's booklink and
sgenglish00004-s001m-07041-08144 prime supermarket  i i can't remember what's on the right because yah  i i know there's dunkin donuts  yah  there's is   so you just w walk straight down  then there were uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-08224-09266 you that you can go to the l to your left or to your right but i think to your right is better because i usually take the to the r the path to the right  so you just
sgenglish00004-s001m-09288-09688 turn right and then you turn left again and there'll be a long long path down
sgenglish00004-s001m-09746-10094 yah   so you just keep walking down that path and
sgenglish00004-s001m-100014-100474 yah yah  so we are a quite materialistic society
sgenglish00004-s001m-101014-101263 abuden  abuden is like
sgenglish00004-s001m-101293-101953 uh it's a local slang of like saying er you don't say  you know like  yah  you don't say  you don't say
sgenglish00004-s001m-10156-10277 you will
sgenglish00004-s001m-102122-102273 uh like
sgenglish00004-s001m-102322-102897 okay  i i give you a hypothetical scenario  so like for example  you know i
sgenglish00004-s001m-103039-103155 i
sgenglish00004-s001m-103248-103382 i went to the
sgenglish00004-s001m-103450-104664 the toilet to take a dump   yah  and then and then you you came by and then you ask me  eh when you take a dump  do you take off for your pants   so like abuden  of course  yah  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-104766-104886 yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-105360-105745 act blur  act blur basically is er er like
sgenglish00004-s001m-105874-106507 it's also  yah all of these are singapore slangs  so act blur is like what it literally means acting blur  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-106536-106735 uh usually applies to
sgenglish00004-s001m-10670-11094 uh you'll pass by this sort of like crossing
sgenglish00004-s001m-106824-107644 people in national service <cs/> sometimes it applies to er people and the working like scenario also  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-107869-108652 act blur is like pretending to not know something when you actually you know like you know  like for example like
sgenglish00004-s001m-108680-109293 er i was given assignment by my supervisor to do like this this
sgenglish00004-s001m-109385-109596 task x  yah let's say
sgenglish00004-s001m-109639-110051 but he he announced it in a meeting  but you know i'm
sgenglish00004-s001m-110147-110599 i i just like choose not to answer or or or what  act blur  so i choose not to
sgenglish00004-s001m-110748-112367 know than o overly know that you know i have a task to do  so when the day er like deadline for task x come up  ah  you know the  oh i i i didn't know that i have such a task you know  ah oh did you did you say such a thing no ah  yah  yah  so this is act blur
sgenglish00004-s001m-11233-12047 but there'll be no cars  usually the car won't drive past there  they will usually make u turns  so you can just walk past  there  then you just keep walking down
sgenglish00004-s001m-112491-112765 uh act cute  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-112877-114026 it just literally means like someone trying to like act really cute  yah  eh it usually applies to to like girls   yah who who try to you know talk in like squeaky voice like
sgenglish00004-s001m-114076-114273 yeah i do  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-114295-114447 er yah  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-114472-114632 usually when when
sgenglish00004-s001m-114666-116142 when people see that usually it's from a third party perspective  so is like  uh like you and me we're sitting here and then like the opposite table that there's this girl over there whose like act  er like doing like this kind of things to some guy  then i'll be like
sgenglish00004-s001m-116190-116341 er you know look at the girl
sgenglish00004-s001m-116511-116661 yah yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-116747-117066 so action  yah  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-117295-118301 action usually is is also another like exclamation to use to like uh disapprove of what somebody does  so  like
sgenglish00004-s001m-118416-119559 uh for example  if a a a guy comes up to the stage to do a speech you know  usually people walk in walk walk to the stage to do a speech  maybe he somersaults
sgenglish00004-s001m-119598-120707 uh you know across the stage and then he lands right in front of the podium to do the speech   so when he does that  people will be like sitting at the audience like wah this guy action ah  you know like like trying to like
sgenglish00004-s001m-121001-121331 such acts  such behaviour
sgenglish00004-s001m-12116-12408 and i think you can see coffee bean
sgenglish00004-s001m-121356-121900 it's not really necessary  so  there hence action
sgenglish00004-s001m-121900-122083 yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-122083-122197 yes
sgenglish00004-s001m-122249-122978 yah  agak agak basically is uh  estimation  yah  it so it's like
sgenglish00004-s001m-123259-124227 you know the like during perhaps during exams you know uh when we we are done with the exams  then you know group of local students outside discussing
sgenglish00004-s001m-124296-125063 so so maybe one of them ask  eh how how did you do like this er question five and then the other guy will be like  oh i just agak agak  er you know
sgenglish00004-s001m-125133-125297 throw in the formula
sgenglish00004-s001m-125326-125634 add the numbers in you know and get the answer  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-125661-126086 er it's like a rough rough estimation
sgenglish00004-s001m-126133-126747 er how o of how people do stuff  yah  it applies to a lot of things
sgenglish00004-s001m-126779-127034 like not not even like studying  like it can be
sgenglish00004-s001m-127299-127843 maybe at while we're waiting for a bus  eh how long will bus come ah   agak agakr maybe like
sgenglish00004-s001m-127924-128227 ten minutes  yah estimated ten minutes  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-128815-129317 yah sure   yah   alright right  glad to help  thank you
sgenglish00004-s001m-12986-14463 okay  er koufu  it is basically the same thing  it's just you have to walk straight for a long time  so  uh what you do is uh you can either choose to take the elevator or you can choose to walk down the stairs  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-14499-14856 uh if you want to take the elevator  you just need to
sgenglish00004-s001m-15149-15369 pass coffee bean  turn left
sgenglish00004-s001m-15436-15954 uh and then there'll be a row of like benches faced er to the side
sgenglish00004-s001m-16035-16268 of the path and then just walk down straight
sgenglish00004-s001m-16304-16843 and then there will be elevator  so you just take the elevator down to the lowest level
sgenglish00004-s001m-16868-17231 i think eh is it lowest or  second lowest
sgenglish00004-s001m-17256-17496 uh second lowest
sgenglish00004-s001m-17601-17820 and then you'll be
sgenglish00004-s001m-17909-18249 the bottom  if you choose to take the stairs  then you have to
sgenglish00004-s001m-18281-18473 walk out of coffee bean
sgenglish00004-s001m-18531-19468 turn right  you'll see like flight of like zigzaging  not zipzaging ah  but jagged stairs you know like   so you just walk walk down the stairs all the way
sgenglish00004-s001m-19519-20379 so comparing those two areas right  you you come down by the elevator  you'll be like to the right side of the long path down the koufu
sgenglish00004-s001m-20401-20623 you come down by stairs  you'll be on the left side
sgenglish00004-s001m-20684-21688 both are the same  you just walk straight down and if you are on either side  just walk straight down all the way   you will pass by some l er l ts er
sgenglish00004-s001m-21718-22022 and then finally you will see uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-22066-22808 the lee kong chian lecture theatre  the lee kong chian l t  there's like a very  nice looking l t  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-22855-23048 so when you see that  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-23074-23561 you can  there will be a s a flight of stairs down  so just take the flight of stairs down
sgenglish00004-s001m-23612-23929 and then once you reach the end of the flight of the stairs  you just
sgenglish00004-s001m-23979-24118 do a u turn
sgenglish00004-s001m-24278-24460 you will c  you can see koufu
sgenglish00004-s001m-25152-25513 er koufu basically is like a
sgenglish00004-s001m-25617-25864 uh what what they call a a
sgenglish00004-s001m-25958-26451 um you want to say it's not a hawker centre but it's it's more of like a foodcourt
sgenglish00004-s001m-26470-26575 food court  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-26664-27774 so you you can see a lot of this uh around singapore uh in the shopping centres  there there's like food republic and and all that  so koufu is actually one of those
sgenglish00004-s001m-27987-28385 companies ah that that operate foodcourts around  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-28463-29658 they did this kind of foodcourts  they usually cater food to everyone's taste  yah  they try to cater to everyone's taste  so that that that's why you see  there's like
sgenglish00004-s001m-29739-30286 there's like indian food  there's like there's like malay food  there's there's chicken rice
sgenglish00004-s001m-30316-31294 chinese food  there's the mixed vegetable rice  you know got all the ingredients there  and there's like noodles  laksa  western western food there's pasta there
sgenglish00004-s001m-31341-31463 and all that  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-33234-33448 okay  er
sgenglish00004-s001m-33579-34177 i think a really nice one would be fried rice
sgenglish00004-s001m-34216-34346 because uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-34479-34838 mo most of the time the the i think
sgenglish00004-s001m-34914-35312 the western uh students from western countries they they seldom have
sgenglish00004-s001m-35519-36138 like exposure to fried rice  e even if you know that there's like other exchange students from
sgenglish00004-s001m-36169-36648 from a other asian countries  that there's like different varieties of
sgenglish00004-s001m-36676-37035 fried rice  so maybe the local one might might taste different
sgenglish00004-s001m-37056-37466 might have different taste because i myself i like to try like different varieties of
sgenglish00004-s001m-37501-37976 fried rice  there's there's no one type of fried rice  there's so many types  there's like  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-38015-38252 salted fish fried rice  there's like
sgenglish00004-s001m-38277-38893 uh also  i i can't even the recall  there's there's just too too too many eh  then there's like silver fish fried rice
sgenglish00004-s001m-38939-39121 yah  sil silver fish is like
sgenglish00004-s001m-39186-39430 is is a
sgenglish00004-s001m-39664-41105 i i want to call it ikan bilis but is but is not  it is basically like a really small like white s fish  you can eat  you can eat the whole whole thing because they they fry and then it's so crispy  you can just  yah  eat the whole thing
sgenglish00004-s001m-41299-41462 oh okay  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-41530-42276 the english word for ikan bilis right is actually an anchovies  yah  so it is really just small fish that
sgenglish00004-s001m-42359-42922 uh  how they cook it in the local style is that usually they will deep fried it
sgenglish00004-s001m-42945-43291 so it's really crispy  you can just you know eat the whole thing and
sgenglish00004-s001m-43318-43570 yah  it's very crunchy  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-43701-45229 uh i used to do that but now not really because it will give me like sore throat and all that  so usually i have it with like um  rice or or or usually they come they come with uh nasi lemak  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-45281-46009 uh okay  nasi lemak is actually uh a malay cuisine  malay food  so  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-46037-46459 i think the literal translation is like i think lemak is
sgenglish00004-s001m-46494-47265 fat or something  yah  and and  and nasi is rice  so er why why there's f like lemak  there's like fat  i think is because of
sgenglish00004-s001m-47304-47893 they when they cook the rice  they they cook it with coconut milk  yah  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-47918-48421 there there's this like aro very nice aroma  very nice uh smell in it
sgenglish00004-s001m-48463-49074 but but it's a kind of  fattening  so ppc yah yah  and and they they accompany the rice with
sgenglish00004-s001m-49290-49933 quite a few ingredients  there's they accompanied with yah  like what what i said just now ikan bilis  peanuts
sgenglish00004-s001m-50018-50759 uh fried chicken  yah usually the fried chicken wing  yah they taste really nice and sometimes they
sgenglish00004-s001m-50823-51246 they pair up with a fried fish  the ikan kuning  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-51758-52269 ikan means fish in malay  yah  so kuning is uh is a
sgenglish00004-s001m-52316-52860 type of fish  yah  it it it is i think it's around like this this big  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-52924-53952 usually they they fry it with like turmeric or something  so so that it will look a bit like yea yellowy orangy  yah but but it's really  tasty because uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-54000-54894 yah  it's deep fried   yah yah yah  and and the good thing about nasi lemak also is er because it it comes with
sgenglish00004-s001m-54932-55120 sambal  which is chilli
sgenglish00004-s001m-55162-56346 yah  and and the chilli is like a  there's a tinge of sweetness to it  so you you mix around with it  you can mix it around with the ingredients  with the rice  it it tastes good ah  and and they end it off with
sgenglish00004-s001m-56377-57105 cucumber  so af after you feeling wah really spicy and hot eh  y y you can just eat  the cucumber to cool yourself down
sgenglish00004-s001m-57105-57248 yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-57248-57524 yah yah   i i eat that often
sgenglish00004-s001m-58146-58441 oh noodles  okay  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-58514-58664 let's see
sgenglish00004-s001m-58900-59419 mee rebus can can also be a good choice because uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-59560-59845 it is it's just yellow noodles uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-59872-62479 cooked in like i think in a some kind of like sweet sauce ah  they they uh no  i'm sorry  they cook the noodles first and then i think they pour  that sweet sauce thing over ah  i i last time when i was i was young ah  i used to drink the sauce   yah  it it's very like savoury but  kind of fattening also at the same time ah   yah  and u usually uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-62611-62839 mee rebus they they have
sgenglish00004-s001m-62950-63201 if i'm not wrong  they have like uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-63226-63927 hard boiled egg inside  oh yah  i i forgot to say nasi lemak also has egg but but it's fried egg   yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-63958-65086 yah  er for mee goreng  is boiled egg because i think it is not really er suit suitable to have fried egg in a soupy soupy dish  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-65148-66229 so they they will have like f a boiled egg and i think some some chicken in inside  if i'm not wrong  and they have like those like tau pok  small small
sgenglish00004-s001m-66286-66392 tau pok inside
sgenglish00004-s001m-66471-67215 yah  and and and they have like  i think they put some veggies like  i think is it coriander or s or something  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-67355-67771 the the v the veggies uh add abit of crunch
sgenglish00004-s001m-67834-68271 to the noodles and then add add a bit of like refreshing taste also
sgenglish00004-s001m-68355-68679 yah  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-69578-70052 okay uh indian food ah
sgenglish00004-s001m-70245-70421 well uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-70640-71650 i think uh nasi briyani you know ah  it is a nice er indian food because i i eat that quite often
sgenglish00004-s001m-71866-72807 they they they have the same around the same name as er malay food like nasi briyani  i'm not sure why that's the case but
sgenglish00004-s001m-72837-73058 it's indian food  but yah   so
sgenglish00004-s001m-73269-74428 the rice that they use is different from the the normal rice in nasi lemak  they use uh basmati rice i think  yah  so it the grains of basmati rice they are quite long
sgenglish00004-s001m-74533-75168 so they looked very unique ah  they they the first time the first time when i saw them i saw it i thought it was
sgenglish00004-s001m-75257-75445 like uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-75789-76652 how to say  mee siam or or yah yah  that was cut up really fine  mee siam is is a kind of like rice with er vermicelli  then yah yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-76862-77678 it is rice that and they usually accompany with uh curry chicken
sgenglish00004-s001m-77772-78690 er and if some some people they don't really like curry chicken  so they they can like have have the option of like fried chicken   yah  but but the thing is that
sgenglish00004-s001m-78755-79098 the chicken is so big  yah especially when
sgenglish00004-s001m-79147-79410 when you have the drumstick
sgenglish00004-s001m-79449-79661 yah  the drumstick is like so big
sgenglish00004-s001m-79811-80603 every time i i save it for the last you know  i i slow slowly eat the rice because uh other than chicken  they they have it with uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-80662-81096 sometimes they give you a piece of cracker   yah  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-81141-81334 is is uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-81565-82575 i don't know what's that call but but that cracker has like some spices in it  so when when you eat the cracker  you know there's crunchy and then there's some spice taste inside  yah
sgenglish00004-s001m-82637-83112 so i usually eat the rice with cracker  then they have like some
sgenglish00004-s001m-83314-84037 salad  uh what how i put it  salad yah  and some cucumber  maybe some onions and all that
sgenglish00004-s001m-84082-84456 so nasi briyani is the rice itself is quite
sgenglish00004-s001m-84685-85067 tasty already by itself  you can actually eat it on it's own because they
sgenglish00004-s001m-85102-86041 they cook it with spices and and some other seasoning  i am i i remember like i seen some kind of seed inside but i don't know what is it called
sgenglish00004-s001m-86101-86661 i think i saw star star anise  yah kind of like herb inside also  so
sgenglish00004-s001m-86794-87247 some herbs and spices  so the rice itself has quite a nice taste
sgenglish00004-s001m-89177-89367 alright  uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-89388-89864 okay  i might not know all of them  so i i'll try to like explain everything
sgenglish00004-s001m-89898-90622 kay  eleven b  er yah  is is a national service lingo basically  eleven b is uh

sgenglish00004-s001m-93904-94592 it it just means four digits i think because  people usually line up at the the betting uh
sgenglish00004-s001m-94625-95276 betting place and then they usually placed their bets on like four numbers that that were open er every

sgenglish00004-s001m-99066-99371 yah car is really expensive in singapore  condominium
sgenglish00004-s001m-99404-99613 cash  credit card
sgenglish00004-s001m-99652-99882 and country club membership
sgenglish00005-s001m-01350-01473 hi
sgenglish00005-s001m-02213-02502 oh just now er i came from school  i stay in the hall
sgenglish00005-s001m-02799-03026 er i have one more paper next monday
sgenglish00005-s001m-03664-03872 er currently in accounting
sgenglish00005-s001m-04187-04346 yah  it was my first choice
sgenglish00005-s001m-04892-06697 oh okay  erm  okay  so like previously right  cause normally on a normal basis right  i like to do like a lot of community service ah  so i was thinking of doing social work  as erm yah but then like after like i talk to a lot of people and like even like s current social workers right   then they were advising like
sgenglish00005-s001m-06702-08877 i'm s like still quite young lah  so like then they say like it's better not to  go straight and and start out as a social worker because like we all know that like social worker like  their hours are long then like they don't get paid very high also   unless you really have the like burning passion in you  which you think can last for very long right  then like you really shouldn't go for it lah  like so like she say like since i remember this social worker once told me that like  she is like
sgenglish00005-s001m-08890-09310 singapore is quite a practical society right  then like  you should
sgenglish00005-s001m-09365-15329 actually do something more practical first  then like  when you are more stable your financial you’re financially more stable right  then  you move on to the social service sector in the future lah because  like erm you don't really need like a social work degree to actually help people lah  like you can actually help it like at your own time  anytime when you are free   even when you are studying also  so like  she say it's better like you can get school on and do something more practical first  so i was like thinking through like a lot of different courses  i know that i i definitely won't want do engineering cause i've done research before and i  really don't like it   then like other aspect like science and i thought like er after j c i thought enough ah science is   that's it ah  no more science already lah   don't really like it also   then like i'm not very language person also  so then like i'm better with numbers ah  so i know like accounting would be a better choice lah   yah  so after i thought so long  then like i thought i might as well just try for accounting ah   like uh a lot of people ask me then why don’t you just go for business ah but  i i was thinking like
sgenglish00005-s001m-100008-100412 different things ah  yah  be it like how to interact with people or be it your
sgenglish00005-s001m-100529-100725 paperwork and stuff  yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-101042-101557 s yah  no more ah  now because very obvious to me also lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-101745-102132 yah  he really like just scolded me for it you know  then i was like wow
sgenglish00005-s001m-102161-102263 so shock
sgenglish00005-s001m-103009-103892 yah  i i was like  i remember the exact word he said to me was like  this space for who  for me is it  wah i was like   i shock ah  i didn't even know how to re respond to that ah
sgenglish00005-s001m-105033-105468 it's just every day scolding about like how bad my paperwork is and stuff lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-106491-106741 um yah  got lah  got lah  i mean like
sgenglish00005-s001m-106805-107766 we have to move on with life lah  no point like y you remember about this kind of bad things all the while because like even though like i didn't feel like he was a good superior  but at least
sgenglish00005-s001m-107776-108273 i don't deny that i did learn things from him lah   like you know how you deal with people and stuff
sgenglish00005-s001m-108305-108608 and h how you should present yourself ah because he was telling me like
sgenglish00005-s001m-108615-108873 i remember at the end before i left right he told me like
sgenglish00005-s001m-108911-109291 he was always very harsh on my paperwork because like he say subsequently when i go uni
sgenglish00005-s001m-109304-110183 i will understand why lah  which i did understand now lah  so like  even though like actually two weeks back  we there was a co cohesion and i met him  like we still talk like normal  then like everything was
sgenglish00005-s001m-110188-110360 okay lah  yah  because like
sgenglish00005-s001m-110364-111122 no matter how bad some things are right  like there's still always a  a positive outcome to it  it just a perspective of life lah   yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-111565-112133 and at at the end  yah lah  during that time when you never lah but in the end  yah  he did  he still did lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-113454-114923 yah  sometimes i will lah like is like oh my god  what like my friends they are formatting but then  i i will just like er at the end i'll just t tie up all everything myself lah because like this not army lah  or i won't scold them or anything lah right   i just do it myself lah  yah  everything is fine lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-116061-116379 m b s friends i won't say no lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-116385-117339 but because like school school started only fourteen weeks ago lah   like i won't say like they are so close until i mean i do have a group of close friends lah but
sgenglish00005-s001m-117349-119642 but m b s you know everyone is busy with their own life and not really ah but i did rope alot of my j c friends in to go with me lah  yah  so like sometimes i volunteer lah and we will meet and then meet there also like a catch up also  as you as you do volunteer work ah because now everyone is dispersed already what  yah  so so so quite nice when you see them coming back also   yah  when you actually see your friend coming back together to volunteer with you   so quite a nice feeling lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-121397-121709 oh er okay  i've okay for me right  like
sgenglish00005-s001m-121720-122379 i take quite a personal stance like in a sense that i try my to tell myself that i do not want to be too personal to them ah because like
sgenglish00005-s001m-122492-122663 as you know like
sgenglish00005-s001m-122671-124238 no dinner last forever lah  so like at the end right  like you have to part also lah  so like i don't want to  end up parting where everyone like very sad  then emotional and then breakdown and cry and stuff lah  because some of some some of them really will do that you know  so like  i told myself right  like i will just like
sgenglish00005-s001m-124256-125449 befriend them but like i don't want to get to personal to them also lah there's always my stance lah  so like but then like it's als i feel like it's just just nice also because like  even subsequently when they come back  they still recognize you  then they will still talk to you
sgenglish00005-s001m-125470-125745 and say hi to you  yah  so i thought like
sgenglish00005-s001m-125754-126397 currently like i'm at a quite okay stairs ah  like where the line is drawn just nice ah  yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-126893-127203 oh oh wow okay  i didn't know i talk so long
sgenglish00005-s001m-15331-15526 what an accounting student can do right
sgenglish00005-s001m-15559-16194 a business student cannot do but uh what a business student can do right  an accounting student can do also lah  so like if i do accounting is more  like
sgenglish00005-s001m-16209-16975 two in one also  like s it makes more sense ah to me lah   yah  so like after all these consideration i thought for quite a long period of time  then i decided do accounting
sgenglish00005-s001m-17590-18062 oh okay  so like back then in my school in my j c right  like
sgenglish00005-s001m-18078-20644 uh every c c a lab and class right  actually like every year we have to do c i p one  it's compulsory for us ah   yah  so  then after that my c c a i remember  then like my vice president he managed to link up with y m c a  then like we started to do a c i p together ah  then subsequently  from then onwards right  even though after i graduated even until now right   i will still continue to do lah because like i found that i really enjoy what i'm doing  enjoy it really serving the community and helping people lah  so yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-21258-26743 er okay  so like erm because now currently right  i do with quite a lot of different organisation also ah but for like let's say for y m c a right   so y m c a part right  i'm not not really say volunteering now already  i'm more of like in the  planning committee  so like i always help to plan like the all the events organisation  not not organisation  sorry the event and all the  i'm in the organising committee ah  so like and then  i help to plan all the events  then have to recruit volunteers in already  because like after you are you volunteer with them for quite some time  then they will usually want you to come and help  them with all their planning and stuff also  so for a y m c a side right  i more of helping to plan events now already rather than actually volunteering already  which is also quite nice because like sometimes right   you will see that regular volunteers also will keep coming back then  they will slowly subsequently they also start to join you onboard to help plan events  then it's quite a nice feeling also ah  yah  then for my other
sgenglish00005-s001m-26802-27799 organisation part like  recently i also join like this organisation called health serve  i'm not sure whether you know about   is it helps like all the foreign workers that are currently like
sgenglish00005-s001m-27802-28473 this they suffer injuries during work  then they cannot work now  so like  what health serve does is like they give them free medical services
sgenglish00005-s001m-28477-29389 to help them like treatment and then like they help them if they are get incur in some law lawsuit because of their injury  but then like their superior though doesn't want to pay or what  then
sgenglish00005-s001m-29402-29700 then they will help them to find lawyers also and like
sgenglish00005-s001m-29713-31120 have to help them settle because like when they come all the way to singapore  they don't have any family or what  they are also very lo they are at a loss ah   so but for my part  because i'm not like medically trained or anything  so what i also help to do is also like occasionally plan events for them
sgenglish00005-s001m-31132-33020 like more of them  just need to be there  to be their friend  you know to accompany them  talk to them   so that they don't feel like lonely ah because like when they don't work also right  they really don't have anything else to do  they just like read every time all the while have nothing to do lah   yah  but recently finals ah  so like now tone down a bit lah   yah  when ah subsequently i'll start continuing soon ah
sgenglish00005-s001m-33369-33498 currently year one
sgenglish00005-s001m-34259-34707 probably lah  yah  so it's it been like since j c even during my army time
sgenglish00005-s001m-34724-35617 cause honestly like it doesn't really take that much of a time right  like  at most every saturday you just go do something  yah  for a few hours only like
sgenglish00005-s001m-35631-35948 it's all how much time you're willing to commit lah this
sgenglish00005-s001m-36437-36594 from school last time  yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-36981-39567 y yah  because like back then in school right  usually cause you know got c i p hours  then last time you always do for the sake of doing for the hours ah  but then like subsequently for me at least ah  like i found that i really actually enjoy it rather than  just doing for the sake of the hours ah which is quite pointless lah  then so even though until now i will still conti continue doing lah because like  it really the satisfaction is there lah when you see that people  really enjoy what you do for them  yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-40367-41894 er in hall  not really lah   hall hall life ve very tiring also ah but as in for n t u side  i also recently i just join w s c side lah   yah  um i went to join the deaf community  to learn sign language also too
sgenglish00005-s001m-41904-42393 so like subsequently next year onwards also  i i will be teaching deaf students tuition also
sgenglish00005-s001m-43470-44786 previously before i came uni cause like you know got a long period of waiting time  then i went to learn ah  but then after that when i found out that like n t u also got the deaf community there   i join them  then they also send us for sign language  classes also lah  so recently  all the classes just ended   then
sgenglish00005-s001m-44789-45140 then next year onwards  we will when we teach the deaf student then
sgenglish00005-s001m-45149-45335 you will use it more already lor
sgenglish00005-s001m-45535-45862 ah yah  okay lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-48302-49567 oh er f currently for now ah my plan is that i will just be an accountant for like a few years  then until like i feel like i'm more financially stable already  then  subsequently in the next time  i maybe then go over to the social service sector
sgenglish00005-s001m-49739-50511 but then of course when during my time as a accountant  i was still like free time ah just go and help also lah because like no harm or what  yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-51401-52905 that one  s maybe next time lah  sees when we got time  then see how lah   yah  because like really lah you don't really need a paper certification to help you  unless you really want to be like a full time social worker or what  then  yah  you need lah but for now it's more i just wanna
sgenglish00005-s001m-52925-53114 volunteer and help people ah because like
sgenglish00005-s001m-53140-53836 i also know that like sometimes right your passion cannot really pick your career lah because  once it  becomes your career right
sgenglish00005-s001m-53876-54214 it's a whole new ball game already lah  like it will change lah  a lot of things to change ah
sgenglish00005-s001m-56584-57929 i won't really say every moment but it's more of like usually at the end of a like an event ah or what because like some if you go back often right  you realize that as in  the beneficiaries of course they will recognize you ah  so then like sometimes  at the end right  like
sgenglish00005-s001m-57935-59977 at the e when they  just come to you right and then like some  erm they just like some some of them like young kids especially   then they will just like  hug you and then say thank you kor kor something  then like wah that moment is like your heart will be like wah melt already   yah  but other than that  i won't say there's a like major event that like impact me lah  it's more of like usually at the end you know
sgenglish00005-s001m-59995-60213 a simple thank you like is good enough already ah
sgenglish00005-s001m-61212-61912 usually as in currently right for me now right  i trying to expose myself to the different kind of
sgenglish00005-s001m-62077-63328 different groups  yah you get what i mean right   so like i have helped like young kids  uh then the poor and then the blind and then currently doing the deaf also   the elderly also  then like more or less i feel like
sgenglish00005-s001m-63347-64086 oh okay lah  but i just realized that i really cannot interact with elderly ah  that's my conclusion ah  so  like it's not say like i don't want to help them or what but
sgenglish00005-s001m-64100-64800 i just got nothing to say to them you know  like i remember this moment that i was just sitting at a table with  another volunteer
sgenglish00005-s001m-64814-67779 then the other volu that volunteer also quit new  then we were with a whole table of elderly right  then like both of us just like awkwardly sitting there like  didn't know what to say you know  then like  because like it's not very nice you just talk to one or two of them  then you neglect the rest  as in like i don't really know how to like engage a group of elderly  then because there's sometimes right elderly tend to be more sensitive  then like i'm also afraid of like saying the wrong thing   yah  so like usually right now right like if i can right  i would avoid working with elderly lah   it's not that i don't want to step out of my comfort zone but i've tried but like  it just doesn't didn't work out lah  so like
sgenglish00005-s001m-67786-68277 besides elderly  most of the time i've exposed myself to most group already lah  then like
sgenglish00005-s001m-68287-68564 even foreign workers also now   so like yah

sgenglish00005-s001m-69101-70404 yah  as in yah  it's not it's not that i'm not okay with them  like if sometimes if they ask me to go and help elderly  i will still go lah but  usually if i can ah  i will just not go lah pplb because like  i really cannot interact  there's just um maybe generation gap or something ah  i just can't ah
sgenglish00005-s001m-70550-71126 then some of them like when they speak like hokkien to you  then like you also understand  then yah  then the language barrier also there
sgenglish00005-s001m-71377-71486 yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-71587-71934 yah  then like sometimes i understand but i don't know how to reply them you know like
sgenglish00005-s001m-74045-75711 er hall b ah  usually i like to run lah on my own ah but er not not like on a competitive basis ah  like own lei lei leisure run  then sometimes run marathon  here and there   free time  yah  nothing much lah  then  if not  means at home watch watch dramas or stuff lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-75724-76107 yah  but in hall in my hall i just play hockey ah but
sgenglish00005-s001m-76158-76989 uh bef bef bef before uni  i didn't have any like experience ah  i just want to try something new also  so yah  other than that yah  that's it lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-78691-79123 wah okay  er  my army life ah  i would say like
sgenglish00005-s001m-79213-79523 it's fulfilling lah  uh yah  because like
sgenglish00005-s001m-79533-80240 my whole of year one  i was like really just doing like all the combat training like  always go in the forest like almost
sgenglish00005-s001m-80248-80529 half half of the time is in the forest one ah  then
sgenglish00005-s001m-80556-81497 lots of training  then everytime get scolding  then like  it's quite like physically and mentally draining lah  but then subsequently  in year two when i
sgenglish00005-s001m-81503-83826 commission already because i was in a officer ah  so then yah  commission already right but then they posted me to h q ah uh headquarter there then  i do a lot of paperwork   so then it's more if if because er like a totally different story because like what you learn  how to fight in a forest  is not relevant in  how to do the paperwork ah  so like but then like the good thing about my army life  i feel like i was there i learn both the hard skill and the soft skills lah   so like you
sgenglish00005-s001m-83830-84516 like hard skill wife like maybe like all the i i'm better at excel now and words   like how to do all the paperwork
sgenglish00005-s001m-84524-84802 but then like soft skills uh you really learn how to like
sgenglish00005-s001m-84861-85805 deal with people lah  like cause you really meet all kind of people  be it your superior  or your or your guys below you lah  like you learn how to  take a different approach
sgenglish00005-s001m-85831-86157 to to to different people ah because like some people right
sgenglish00005-s001m-86204-87618 even though like army people always think discipline discipline but some people obviously they clearly don't care one ah   yah  some people don't they they just don't bother one ah  so like you need to find like  many different ways to approach them  like if you want to get them to do things  scolding doesn't always help you know like
sgenglish00005-s001m-87636-88033 you you need to find like what's the right way to approach them  some of them like
sgenglish00005-s001m-88056-88683 it's better if you can approach them from a friend point of view  but rather some of them like y some of them it's just like
sgenglish00005-s001m-88733-89325 y they they don't really want to help you no matter what one ah  so like you really need to see  how to work your way
sgenglish00005-s001m-89340-89511 around things lor   yah
sgenglish00005-s001m-89515-90268 yah  then like when you talk to your superior also  like some of them  just very anal about things you know  like  i remember once my superior right like
sgenglish00005-s001m-90275-91766 my document i submitted like s my report to him lah  then then after that he look  he he call me to his office right  then after that ask him   yah  so um is there any wrong thing wrong with my thing lah   then he pointed er to the to me it's like this this spacing lah in between two words right
sgenglish00005-s001m-91783-91927 then he ask me what's wrong
sgenglish00005-s001m-91958-93020 then i look at him  i i don't see anything wrong ah  then he say can't you this space so big for who  he ask me  is it for me  then i say er no ah sir  ppbl then you double space for what
sgenglish00005-s001m-93052-93156 then i was like
sgenglish00005-s001m-93239-94721 er okay  sorry sir   yah  then i was like damn stun ah because like double spacing like i didn't even realise it notice it  but he actually like noticed that i double space by accident   then like he made me redo the whole thing and like reprint the whole thing  then he scolded me for wasting paper cause i didn't my job properly but
sgenglish00005-s001m-94726-95893 i was just like my my thinking like if you are willing because he doesn't like to read softcopy  he like to be hardcopy   then i was thinking like if you were willing to read softcopy  then like  i wouldn't have to waste paper also right  but then like
sgenglish00005-s001m-95905-96201 also my fault lah cause like i double space lah  yah lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-96236-96602 yah  cause he is very anal about like all the formatting and paperwork lah
sgenglish00005-s001m-96616-100004 yah  so like  you really learn  you really meet all kind of people in the army lah  then like i thought like  yah  so i really like learn a lot in army ah  yah  but like then in a sense also lah <c/ even though he was very strict on my paperwork  i like right now it help lah because like you do a lot of reports in uni and stuff right   then i now become very anal also ah  then like at at the end of like reports right  i will i will just tell my friends i will do your formatting ah because like  become a habit already you know  like all the s font size must be the same  must be the same font   spacing must  be equal  don't double space also   yah  it becomes a habit also then  naturally  so like i guess army really taught me a lot of

sgenglish00006-s001m-107586-107766 furry animals
sgenglish00006-s001m-107779-108177 because it's like collect dust and it doesn't really
sgenglish00006-s001m-108233-108528 and our hall is not even that big also and if she

sgenglish00006-s001m-10940-11557 in er malay is everlasting and sangkum means hope in the c
sgenglish00006-s001m-110410-111386 oh no because we each have our one dustbin and each have our own laundry bag  so is  like we do whatever we we do what we have what is our own ah  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-111565-114083 oh i don't i don't mind cleaning the room on my own  it's like whenever i'd i mean it's not until to extent that i clean the window because i mean it   it doesn't like i cannot see it  so it's okay   right so it's mostly the floor because we have a lot of hair  then we like keep our hair keep dropping  so we just  so i will just like whenever i there's a lot of hair  then i will just um i'll just wipe it ah  which i don't mind ah because it's also  a good habit to pick up  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-114098-114207 yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-114666-115054 yah  she's neater than me  so yah  she's neater than me
sgenglish00006-s001m-115456-115556 okay
sgenglish00006-s001m-11571-12828 khmer language  it's the cambodia language   so it translate to er everlasting hope  and i mean the programme's department where we plan the bulk of the education and the construction there
sgenglish00006-s001m-12847-14275 so we have er we so we are planning act to teach them english  maths  science  and mostly we are teaching grade one to six for the first part of the trip and then after that   it's uh younger kids for the second part of the trip  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-14629-16744 because in the am the malay culture society perbayu right  um o e was the only one which was humanitarian   which want will which was helping the kids ah and i know i was going to be  heavily involved since it's a overseas expedition but then  i wanted to try something new because last semester  i was quite bored with just studying  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-17271-19081 so i i hope to um be more grateful with what i have and open my mind to more  uh opportunities and because for me  i am more or i'm not the kind that will take risks  so i hope i'm hoping that with these o e  i will take more risks during their trip and even after that also
sgenglish00006-s001m-19841-20868 yah  we have mostly b the bulk is proposal but i don't mind because ever since in secondary school  i enjoyed doing these admin proposal work and planning  because i don't really like
sgenglish00006-s001m-20881-21837 um i don't really like no not knowing what the programme is  so i rather be in control of the programme and know and like give my  maca uh like to
sgenglish00006-s001m-21861-22867 my two cents worth of what i want the programme to be like  and how i think it should be because  i feel like if i wasn't in the programmes' team  then i would i may not like what i'm doing  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-22945-23045 yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-23418-24305 yah  more of er knowing what i eh i have to do and in control of what i can do and whether it is beneficial for the kids or not ah  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-24853-27983 yah  it's um to educate the kids and to because even though we have um how to say like the less advantage people in singapore   is not as it's not as bad as the other countries like for example in cambodia because it's still in singapore  we are still quite shelter and pampered because for our pre trip  we have to also volunteer in another org in an organization like  muhammadiyah or darul ihsan  eh that kind of organisations with kids  but then we realized that even the kids there  even the
sgenglish00006-s001m-27989-30000 erm in even the people we talk to  they're like the staff there are aware that the people in singapore are not as  erm are not as disadvantaged as those in cambodia and  they are given food  they are they have proper education and proper clothing and all  so  um in singapore  i won't say that the
sgenglish00006-s001m-30045-30752 disadvantaged are as bad as those a abroad  so i ra i want to go there and actually experience it first hand  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-32156-32400 yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-32766-34285 big  uh i think if i'm going with at least someone i'm comfortable with   then i don't mind because i'm more of a people person and i need someone to lean on  and  uh i'm not the kind that will go on solo trips that like
sgenglish00006-s001m-34287-35650 will actually come out of my comfort zone and do all these things on my own because  i want someone to be dependent on  someone i can share with ah if i'm on the trip  and if i'm going on this big kind of all the way to africa
sgenglish00006-s001m-35656-36574 then if it's with people that i'm comfortable with like family  i don't mind going but if it's like new people that i don't i haven't met before  then i'm not comfortable in going  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-37466-37616 i t is
sgenglish00006-s001m-37629-38042 yah  personally to me i think it's maybe uh just
sgenglish00006-s001m-38057-38314 the development like
sgenglish00006-s001m-38328-39316 if even if  you don't have these basic things  i guess you would need to have a positive thinking and the government needs to learn how to  adapt to the changing
sgenglish00006-s001m-39334-40091 changing climate of the world and actually dev continue developing  instead of just staying stagnant at  as a third world country  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-40500-40652 yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-41705-44462 i'm cause now i'm staying in hall  so i rarely have the chance to interact with my neighbours or anything and  my house is at the is at the area where  it's like one corridor only has two units  so i only have one other neighbour and  i'm not mostly at home even though  where even when i'm not in hall also i'm not at home  like in secondary school or j c  i'm rarely at home  i'll always be in school  so i rarely have the chance to interact with them  so i would say that
sgenglish00006-s001m-44472-45045 er i don't really help because yah  the i can't really help also at the same time  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-45254-45924 yah  i have one other sister who is twenty nine now  so it's a big age gap of nine years  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-46042-46506 uh no  she's she's not married er but she's working
sgenglish00006-s001m-46641-46819 yah  she stays with my parents
sgenglish00006-s001m-46953-47377 er she also not really close to the neighbours cause she
sgenglish00006-s001m-47411-49322 can be she's like me  she's can be social  she's sociable if i want to but the other  like cause my neighbours are not the kind that will be sociable also  like the other just the one other neighbor  so  if they are not sociable  so i won't really go out of my way to like oh hi how's your day that kind  so it kind of like  mine is like bounce off kind of social  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-49735-49849 friendly
sgenglish00006-s001m-49985-51554 oh no  cause the one other unit uh that is along the corridor is me is er we have the they keep changing  so this is throughout my whole nine nineteen years is they are the third neighbor to live there already   so before that was er um
sgenglish00006-s001m-51589-54707 it was another family also  but we weren't really close cause they they stayed there and then they moved out again because we had lift renovation work and they will had and they had a baby  so they didn't want to stay there for long but  before that  we were very close to this uh  other family because they always  when they cook right  then they will give us some leftovers or yah  and then  they also cause their families also always come over  so whenever their families come  then we also know their families ah and they are very friendly people  so  yah  uh we are very close to that neighbour because
sgenglish00006-s001m-54719-55203 erm i was in the same school as that neighbour also  and she will
sgenglish00006-s001m-55207-56754 and whenever cause my i both my parents work and they have grandparents in that house  so whenever after school  i will actually go over to their house and  like do my work or they would take care of me and feed me  yah  so that's like the nicest memory i have ah
sgenglish00006-s001m-56798-56901 yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-57175-58558 yah  my parents are still in touch because they also still um i still stay in tampines and they also they also still stay in tampines   so whenever they have weddings or any big gatherings  they will invite my parents and yah  hari raya also they will invite my parents  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-59404-61878 yah  i think i'll continue being the bouncer also because i'm scared  when whenever i become too friendly  i'm scared that they will be  like i'll be too intrusive into their life or  cause even personally for myself  if i'm not in the friendly mode   i won't be i don't want anyone to be like oh hi how's your day  i want people to give me my space  yah   so maybe like there are certain people that are like that and i respect that ah
sgenglish00006-s001m-62679-63589 i think because they are the ones that will be there when you're not around at home and your home is where you always go to and without without them i feel
sgenglish00006-s001m-63620-65280 you won't have anyone to rely on if there's a real there's a real emergency  like for example if you're  overseas or something and you need to water your plants or  er you left something behind or you just suspect something wrong with   then you can always count on your neighbours ah  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-66133-66258 yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-66708-66949 yah  cause um
sgenglish00006-s001m-66999-67981 i think it's good that the government has put in the you know the racial quota  only certain race can you up to a maximum quota  and there are also
sgenglish00006-s001m-67998-70775 a lot of events that the g r c will organise  er i think it's the g r c  yah i'm not so sure  but  at the c c  they will organise like oh  if there's chinese new year coming around  then they will oh chinese new year gathering or hari raya gathering or deepavali gathering   so  it's like this kind of um small  not say small  but smaller scale events for the neighborhood that can bring people together   like f when my father is also er like an r c member
sgenglish00006-s001m-70782-72390 yah  so he is also in charge of like organizing this thing and he pulls us along some time  so  from that also he can meet like people living around us and  um we can meet our neighbours  even though it may not be direct but at least it's within the same area
sgenglish00006-s001m-73804-74401 um maybe by going to the um events  then maybe pulling
sgenglish00006-s001m-74431-75079 if  i don't know  maybe pulling my friends along also  yah cause i do have friends who stay in the same area
sgenglish00006-s001m-75100-77189 en yah  and actual and not just go ah but actually interact with the people there cause even though if you go also then if you don't interact then it's a bit  um pointless  so actually just go and interact and  when you see the same few faces in the at the carpark or  at the void deck or wherever then just say hi  yah  that kind of thing
sgenglish00006-s001m-77394-77501 yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-78101-78525 language barrier ah  language barr  not really because
sgenglish00006-s001m-78561-79161 only with the older people but my h d b don't really have that many
sgenglish00006-s001m-79163-79338 old people lah and
sgenglish00006-s001m-79375-80453 yah  and most of them can speak english  even if it's the most basic english  so at least can still understand each other and stuff   and even though they cannot speak english  they can actually speak malay  so it's like
sgenglish00006-s001m-80475-81158 nope  so either way also still can communicate  yah even though they are not malay  they can uh still understand abit of malay  yah
sgenglish00006-s001m-81473-82030 er f s how many month  this sem and last semester
sgenglish00006-s001m-82113-82443 yah  because i'm in year one  so yah  so
sgenglish00006-s001m-82506-83235 yah  ever since the start of me entering uni  i've been in staying in hall but then  last semester  i stay in hall twelve
sgenglish00006-s001m-83242-84193 alone like in a single room   eh because i wasn't sure of how i would act i will how i would like it if i had a roommate because all along i've been living on my own
sgenglish00006-s001m-84208-84580 then i stay in hall twelve and i didn't really like it because
sgenglish00006-s001m-84603-86882 it was it didn't have any lift  so yah  so i and i stay on the seventh floor but then the first floor of like my where my staircase starts is at the fourth floor but bis because it's upclope to my hall  so i didn't like the end    there was only a laundry r one laundry room at the fourth floor  so have to go all the way up  go all the way up  so it was quite tiring  and i didn't like living on my own
sgenglish00006-s001m-86912-87260 yah  and the hall twelve was very open  like
sgenglish00006-s001m-87300-89780 there was it wasn't there wasn't any gender segregation  so  like the boys can co access can have access to the female block and the female will have access to the male block and even so right  it's like  a u shape and girls can see the boys' room and the boys can see the girls' room  so it's like a bit of um i didn't like i didn't really like  that was so awkward  so i decided to go for tamarind  which is like a more  like
