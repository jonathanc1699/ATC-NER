yes but we need about ten more minutes related to weight and we can land but we have to brief the cabin and get set up
but if i call you is that ok
no that is not a problem we do not have any failure or anything now it is just a vibration when on full power for now only at full power but from company they would like us to return

K L M two five bravo descend flight level one one zero and contact one two six decimal six eight zero discrete frequency
descend flight level one one zero and one two six six eight zero K L M two five bravo
amsterdam hello K L M two five bravo descending flight level one one zero
K L M two five bravo this is discrete frequency at the moment so you can take all your time expect a left turn here in a few miles to keep you near the field
roger and we are ready for the approach K L M two five bravo
sorry you said you are ready for the approach

K L M two five bravo turn left heading one niner zero
left heading one niner zero K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo just to be sure no assistance needed upon landing 
negative for the moment not K L M two five bravo
okay that is copied and i am gonna sort things about the runways wind is right in between the three six right and the runway two seven
crosswind limit is three one so not a problem K L M two five bravo
that is copied at the moment two seven gives you three one zero two niner gusting forty and i see crosswind of two niner for that
we can accept two seven if that is more convenient two five bravo
yea i am going to coordinate with the tower
in the meantime request further descent K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo heading one eight zero descend flight level niner zero
one eight zero descend flight level niner zero K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo it will be runway two seven descend now to flight level five zero
two seven and descend flight level five zero K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo turn left heading one six zero i will give you some extra track miles
left one six zero K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo you will cross the localizer for the altitude so no rush for that it will be a right turn after corossing the localizer
that is copied roger K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo turn right heading two four zero 
right turn two four zero K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo any windshear report last half an hour
two five bravo descend now to negative maintain flight level five zero for the time
maintain five zero K L M two five zero
K L M two five bravo no windshear reported on runway two seven for the last half hour and for your information it is going to be a slight delay vectors to vector you behind traffic landing on the three six right for now turn right heading three six zero
right turn three six zero K L M two five bravo
K L M two five bravo descend to two thousand feet Q N H one zero one zero
